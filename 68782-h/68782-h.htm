  <h2 class='c005'>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The history of the Philippine Islands is little known
to its people to-day, for the records are few and not
easy of access. Just at the present time this knowledge
is especially necessary to the Filipino people. A
knowledge of the conditions of the past is of the greatest
importance to a people desirous of planning wisely
and well for the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Story of the Philippines” aims to teach Filipino
young people the salient facts regarding the past
of their country, and, besides this, it points out some of
the things needful to the best growth and progress
of the islands. Certain chapters are devoted to matters
pertaining to geography, commerce, and government,
directing attention to the main physical features of the
country and the possibilities of its successful development,
and touching upon lines of commercial and social
advancement which lie just ahead. The book shows
that the Filipinos have a past filled with the records of
brave deeds and patient forbearance; that they have a
beautiful country, rich in natural resources; and that the
future development and prosperity of their islands depend
largely upon themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The volume has been prepared in order to fill a definite
educational need in the schools of the Philippine
Islands, and as the first secular history of their land to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>be brought within reach of Filipino school children it
should be of real value. But it is not only to the
teachers and pupils in the schools that this book is
useful; it should appeal to all who live in the Philippine
Islands and all others who are interested in them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has had access to the best historical material
available in the Philippines and in America. The
book was written in the islands, and as nearly as possible
from the standpoint of the people. It is impossible
to name the many devoted friends of the islands—Filipinos
and Americans—who have helped to make
this book possible. No mere words of thanks can express
the obligation of the author and publishers to
them; but their aid was given in a spirit of desire to
help in the education of Filipino young people. If the
book does this, their reward will be commensurate with
the great service they have rendered.</p>

When Christopher Columbus (kris´to fer kō-lum´bus)
discovered America, in the year
1492, he set all Europe talking about the
unknown lands that lay beyond seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time little was known of geography. Most
people believed that the world was flat, and that if
a man were to reach the edge he could jump off into
space. Some people thought, too, that this great,
flat earth rested on the backs of four huge tortoises,
and that the movements of these creatures caused
earthquakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sailors believed that somewhere in the Atlantic
Ocean Satan lived. When a ship was wrecked they
thought that Satan had reached out an awful hand
and dragged the ship down into the sea. Even learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>captains believed this, and declared that they had seen
ships drawn under in this manner. To them the great,
dashing waves in a storm must have looked like huge
hands, and so they made this mistake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sea was full of terror to those sailors of long
ago; yet they braved it. They went forth in frail
little ships, such as a modern sailor would hardly risk
a voyage in. Until a short time before Columbus’s
day they even had no compass, but were guided by
the winds and the stars. They made long voyages
in their tiny ships, and little by little they began to
see that those who said that the world is round, and
not flat, must be right.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1513, a little over twenty years after
Columbus’s discovery, a Spanish captain named Balboa
(bäl bō´ä) reached Central America. With his soldiers
he crossed the Isthmus of Darien (dā rē ȧn´), and discovered
the great ocean which washes the western coast of
America. This ocean he named the “Southern Sea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Men were in those days slowly groping their way
across seas to the new lands. Of course, as soon as
they knew of this ocean, they wanted to find a way to
sail into it from the Atlantic Ocean. They knew that
if they could do this they would have a shorter route
from Europe to the famed “spice islands” which were
believed to be in the South Seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time there came to Spain a great soldier
and sea-captain named Ferdinand Magellan (fêrd´ī nänd
m̤a jel´̤an). He was a Portuguese noble, a clever man
of much learning. While yet a very young man he
became an officer in the Portuguese navy, and fought
for his king in many far countries.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>During a war which Portugal waged in Africa, Magellan
was badly wounded in one knee, so that he was
ever after lame. On his return to Portugal from
Africa, other captains of the king became jealous of
his fame and tried to belittle all that he had done.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>KING CHARLES I.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>They told the king untrue tales about him, and
made the sovereign believe
evil against him.
Among other things,
they said that he was
pretending to suffer
from a malady of
which he had once
been a victim, but of
which he was really
cured. They said that
he did this because he
did not wish to serve
the king any longer.
So they stirred up the
king’s mind against
the brave captain, and
Magellan was very
badly treated. At
last, deeply hurt by the king’s unfairness, he left the
country. He went to Spain, and became a subject of
King Charles I.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of Spain gave Magellan a warm welcome.
He was glad to have him at court, and listened eagerly
to what Magellan had to say about certain rich islands
that lay in the Southern Sea. Many sailors from Spain
and from Portugal had heard of these islands, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>when they returned from their voyages to the Malay
Peninsula in the East, they told how they had seen,
in Malacca harbor, dusky traders from that unknown
land. None of them knew, however, just where these
islands lay.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last King Charles I. made a compact with Magellan.
He made the captain a cavalier of Spain, and
fitted out a fleet for him. Magellan pledged himself
to spend ten years trying to find the southern islands
for Spain, and the king gave to him and to his heirs
the governorship of all islands that he might discover
and conquer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on August 10, 1519, that Magellan’s fleet,
flying the royal standard of Spain, left San Lucar de
Barrameda (sän lö´cär dā bär rä mā´thä). There were
five ships, <i>La Trinidad</i> (lä trē´nē däth), <i>San Antonio</i>
(sän än tō´nē ō), <i>Victoria</i> (vik tō´rē ä), <i>Santiago</i> (sän
tē ä´gō), and <i>Concepcion</i> (kōn thep´thē ōn). They sailed
southward, from San Lucar de Barrameda toward the
Canary Islands, and on the 13th of December reached
Rio de Janeiro (rē´ō dā zhä nā´rō).</p>

<p class='c007'>From there they went along down the eastern coast
of South America, trying every opening which they
thought might be a passage into the sea they sought.
They lost a good deal of time sailing up the Rio de la
Plata (rē´ō dā lä plä´tä), and at last had to come back
to the Atlantic. By this time it was late in winter,
and the weather was very cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>By now the officers and sailors on all save Magellan’s
own ship had become rebellious. They were sure that
no passage could be found into the Southern Sea, and
they wanted to go back to Spain. This rebellion grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>until Magellan had to put it down by the use of force.
He was able to win over the sailors, but the officers
still made trouble, and at last their revolt was so serious
that the fleet could not go on until this matter
was ended. One captain even made an attack on <i>La
Trinidad</i>, the ship which Magellan commanded. Not
until one of the rebellious captains, with a companion,
was put ashore, another killed, and a third executed
for mutiny, was order restored so that the fleet could
continue the voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the way was long and trying. The sailors began
to lose courage again, and only the bravery and strong
will of Magellan kept the fleet together. One ship,
the <i>Santiago</i>, was wrecked in a great gale, and while
off the coast of New Guinea (nö gin´nē) the crew and
most of the officers of the <i>San Antonio</i> mutinied. They
put their captain in irons and sailed back to Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>There they lodged a complaint against their captain
and against Magellan. They accused the latter of
great cruelty, and raised much ill feeling against him.
Magellan’s wife and family were put into prison, and
if the cavalier himself had been in Spain, it would have
gone hard with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Magellan was very far from Spain. With the
three remaining ships he was still sailing in search of
a passage into the sea which Balboa had discovered.
On the 28th day of October, 1520, the fleet reached
the seaway now known as the Straits of Magellan, between
Patagonia (pat ä gō´nē ä) and Tierra del Fuego
(tē er´rä del fwā´gō).</p>

<p class='c007'>Hardly daring to hope that this was the passage they
sought, they entered it and sailed on. Nearly a month
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>later, on November 26, 1520, they passed out of the
Straits and found themselves on the broad, blue Southern
Sea. This sea was so quiet, so fair and beautiful,
that Magellan at once named it the “Pacific,” or
“peaceful,” Ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>The longed for seaway was discovered, and they
were the first to sail through it! We may be sure that
the hearts of the little company were glad. There was
no more doubt; no more grumbling; no more rebellion
against their leader. They knew, at last, that he was
a great captain, and they followed him willingly across
the unknown sea. They were now full of hope for the
success of their voyage. They were eager to reach
the rich spice islands which they were sure lay before
them, and the ships sailed bravely forward over the
beautiful Pacific.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 16, 1521, they came to the Ladrone
(lä drōne´) Islands. To these Magellan gave the name
Islas de las Velas (ēs läs dā läs vā´läs). It was Miguel
de Legaspi (mē gā´el dā lā gäth´pē) who, when he
visited them in 1564, called them the Ladrones. The
expedition did not linger here, however, but soon sailed
away toward the southwest, where the Spaniards hoped
to find the spice islands which they sought.</p>

<p class='c007'>They held steadily to their westward course, and in
due time reached Jomohol (hō mō hōl´), now called
Malhon (mäl hōn´), in the Straits of Suragao (sö rä gä´ō),
between Samar (säm´är) and Dinegat (dē nā gät´). Here
they touched, but did not remain. They sailed on
along the coast of Mindanao (mēn dä nä´ō), instead,
and early in Easter week came to the mouth of the
Butuan (bö tö än´) River.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>They were nearly out of food and water by this time,
so they landed to see what supplies they could find.
The chief of Butuan and his people were at first frightened
by the sight of these white strangers. The Spaniards
wore armor and carried firearms. They must
have seemed strange to those simple people, who had
never before seen such men or such weapons. The
natives welcomed the strangers, and brought them fresh
food and water. They helped the Spaniards to load
these on their ships, and were in every way friendly.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards Magellan claimed the country for King
Charles I. of Spain, and raised the Spanish flag. The
chief looked on during this act, and consented to it;
but it is not likely that he knew what Magellan was
doing. Then Magellan named the country the San
Lazarus (sän lāth´är ůs) Isles.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Magellan learned from the Butuan people that a rich
and fertile island called Cebu (sā´bö) lay to the north,
and to this island he wished to go. The chief of
Butuan then offered to go with him and show him
the way; so, with the chief and some of his people,
the fleet sailed to Cebu. They reached harbor there
April 7, 1521.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first the Cebuans (sā´bö äns) were very unfriendly
toward the strangers, and, but for the chief of Butuan,
would have driven them away. He answered for the
Spaniards, however. He told the king of Cebu that
they wished to be friends, and at last the Spaniards
were allowed to land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Magellan must have had the good gift of making
friends, for he soon won over the king of Cebu just as
he had won over the chief of Butuan. He and the
king swore friendship, and each drank blood drawn
from the breast of the other. This they did for a sign
that thereafter they were to be brothers. Magellan
also made a treaty with the king in the name of King
Charles I. of Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were a number of Spanish friars with the fleet.
These at once began to teach the people, and before
long the king was baptized as King Charles I. of Cebu.
Many of his people were baptized also. Magellan then
promised the Cebuans to help them in a war which
they were having with the people of Mactan (mäk´tän),
an island near Cebu. To keep this promise, Magellan
crossed to Mactan with forty of his men in the evening
of April 25th. He would not let any of the Cebuans
go with him, as he wished to show them how quickly
Spanish soldiers would defeat such a foe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The Spanish landed at night, and as soon as it was
light the people of Mactan came down to the beach in
great numbers. A fierce battle was fought, in which
the Europeans, being greatly outnumbered, were defeated.
One old Spanish account says that the Spanish
soldiers sprang into the water and swam to the ships,
leaving their leader on shore. Magellan was a skillful
swordsman, and killed many of the enemy. At last,
however, a savage, who fought with a huge club, struck
him a blow that crushed both his helmet and his skull.
He died, there by the sea, on the island of Mactan,
and a monument to his memory now stands on the
spot where it is supposed that he fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the right bank of the River Pasig (pä´sig), in
Manila, near the bridge of Spain, is another monument
in honor of this brave nobleman and soldier.
Ferdinand Magellan ranks with the great sailors of the
world. Not even Columbus was wiser or more skillful
than he. The discovery of the passage between the
two great oceans, and the long, dangerous journey
across seas to these islands, are feats that make him
worthy of a high and honorable place in the world’s
history.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the death of Magellan, Captain Duarte Barbosa
(dö är´tā bär bo´thä) took command of the fleet. The
king of Cebu had not sworn friendship with him, however,
and the chief of Butuan had gone back to his
home, so the Spanish had no strong friend in the
island. The king invited Barbosa and his men to a
feast on the island, and at this feast the captain and
twenty-six of his men were killed. The Cebuans
offered to give up a Spanish sailor named Juan Serrano
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>(hō än´ sā rä´nō) for two cannons from one of the ships,
but the Spanish would not come inshore to bring the
cannons and take their shipmate on board. They
sailed away and left him to his fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all, thirty-two Spaniards were killed at Cebu.
This left them so short of men that they could not get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the three ships away. So, as the <i>Concepcion</i> was the
poorest of the three, they sunk her in Cebu harbor.
After doing this they made haste to get away from the
scene of their ill fortune. Captain Juan Caraballo
(kär ä bäl´yō) was now made commander of the expedition,
and with less than a hundred men all told, the
two ships went on to Borneo.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese noble, leaving
his own country because of ill treatment, became a subject
of Spain. King Charles I. fitted out a fleet for him,
and Magellan agreed to spend ten years seeking for islands
in the Southern Sea, to conquer for Spain. On August 10,
1519, the fleet sailed from San Lucar de Barrameda, southward.
Magellan sailed down the eastern coast of South
America, seeking a passage into the ocean which Balboa had
discovered and named the Southern Sea. They had many
hardships. One ship was wrecked and one deserted; but on
October 28, 1520, they reached the passage now known as
the Straits of Magellan. This passage is between Patagonia
and Tierra del Fuego. They sailed through the Straits, and
on November 26, 1520, entered the Southern Sea. Magellan
named this sea the Pacific Ocean. On March 16, 1521, the
fleet reached the Ladrone Islands. They did not remain long,
but sailed toward the southwest. They touched at Malhon,
and went on along the coast of Mindanao. They landed at the
mouth of the Butuan River, and were well received by the
chief and his people. Magellan claimed the country for
Spain. The chief of Butuan went with the Spanish to Cebu.
Magellan swore friendship with the king of Cebu, and the
latter was baptized. Magellan, with forty Spaniards, offered
to fight the people of Mactan, who were at war with the
Cebuans. Magellan was killed, however, and the Spaniards
were driven back. The new Spanish leader was killed, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>twenty-six of his men, at a feast given by the king of Cebu
on shore. The Spanish sunk one of their ships; and the
other two, with all the Spaniards left, sailed for Borneo.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—What did people believe in the time of Columbus
about the shape of the earth? What did they think
about the sea? What European first saw the Pacific Ocean?
How did he reach it? Who was Magellan? How did he
come to take service with the king of Spain? When did
Magellan’s fleet leave Spain? What course did it take?
Tell when he discovered the Straits. Where did Magellan
go after entering the Pacific? Give an account of his landing
at Butuan. Where did he go next? How did he die?
What then became of the fleet?</p>

In the month of September, 1522, a few
weeks over three years after Magellan’s
proud fleet sailed from San Lucar de Barrameda,
in Spain, a single ship put into that
port. She was seaworn and battered, with torn sails,
and timbers warped and scarred by many a storm. The
people hailed her with joy, and everywhere in Spain
men were glad when they heard of her safe home-coming.
This ship was the <i>Victoria</i>, commanded by Captain
Juan Sebastian del Cano (sā bäs´tē än del kä´nō),
a statue of whom now stands in the main hall of the
Palacio in Manila. She was the only one left of the
five ships that had gone out with Magellan three years
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>But battered and scarred as she was, the <i>Victoria</i> was
a ship to be proud of. She had sailed clear around the
world, and at that time no other ship had ever done
such a thing. No wonder, then, that everybody was
glad to see her, and was proud of her. The people were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>sorry when they learned of the sad fate of Magellan,
but there were still brave captains and clever seamen
in Spain, and these at once began making plans to go
to the new-found San Lazarus Isles.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the expeditions that were fitted out was lost;
but in 1542 a second company left the city of Navidad
(nä vē däth´) in Mexico, or New Spain, as that country
was often called. This one was commanded by a Spanish
nobleman named Ruy Lopez de Villalobos (rē lō peth´dā
vēl yä lō’bos). After a long, hard journey the expedition
reached the island now called Samar. The
Spanish did not try to settle there, but Ruy Lopez
named this island Isla Filipina, in honor of Prince
Philip of Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>That one little fact is of interest to us, because about
a year later a certain Spanish gentleman who was writing
a letter home from Mexico spoke of the whole
group of islands as Las Islas Filipinas. This name was
at once taken up in Spain. No one remembered that
Magellan had named the islands San Lazarus, but
every one called them Islas Filipinas; and so these
Philippine Islands received a name which they have
ever since kept.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish gentleman who wrote that letter was
Don Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. He was a nobleman
of Spain, but for many years he lived in Mexico.
He was one of the many great men who, in early times,
made Spain’s name a proud one. He was a young man
when he went to New Spain and began to practice law.
He was an honest gentleman and an able statesman,
and before many years he was made mayor of the City
of Mexico. He seems to have been a truly religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>man, wise and just;
a man to trust, and
one well able to
lead other men.
For such men
there are always
high places in the
world. Legaspi
was, moreover, a
brave soldier and
a skillful sailor.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>STATUE OF SEBASTIAN DEL CANO.<br /><br />In the Palacio, Manila.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not strange,
therefore, that the
king of Spain
should have known
about him. The
king at this time
was Philip II., for
whom, when he
was prince, these
islands were
named. He came
to the throne in
1555, and soon after
was minded to send
out an expedition
to settle in the
country named for
him. He looked
about for a man to
command this expedition,
and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>choice fell upon Legaspi. So he made him general of
the whole force.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were four ships and a frigate in the new fleet,
and all were strongly armed and well stocked for the
journey. The force of men numbered 400 soldiers
and sailors, carefully chosen, and fit for the brave adventure
before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the fleet there were also six friars of the Order
of St. Augustine, and the leader of these was a man
after Legaspi’s own heart. His name was Andres de
Urdaneta (än´drās dā ur´dä nā´tä). He had been at
one time a captain in King Charles’s navy, and had
long wanted King Charles I. to send him on an expedition
to the Pacific. But the king was weary of wars
and longed for rest. Of his own accord he left the
throne, to retire into private life; and Urdaneta took
holy orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Philip II. was making ready his great expedition,
he remembered his father’s friend Urdaneta,
and chose him to go with Legaspi as captain of the
spiritual forces of the fleet. These two men, Legaspi
and Urdaneta, were warm friends. It is very fitting
that in the monument on the Luneta in Manila, their
figures should to-day stand side by side. When we
see this monument, we should remember the brave
journey these two men made together years ago, and
the bright future which they hoped to secure for these
islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>This new fleet sailed from Navidad, on the coast
of Mexico, on the 21st day of November, 1564. The
expedition was unlike the ones that had gone before
it. It had for its aim the setting up of Spain’s rule in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the islands, whereas the others had gone out to seek
new lands and to conquer them. The men with Legaspi
meant to stay in the islands and to make their
homes there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legaspi had been warned not to go first to Cebu.
His advisers thought it would be better to settle on
one of the other islands and slowly to make friends
with the Cebuans before going to live among them.
This, however, was not Legaspi’s plan. He knew
that the Cebuans were the very people whom he must
win over at first, if he hoped to have peace in his new
home. You see, the Spaniards as yet knew nothing
about the great island of Luzon. They had no knowledge
of the size and nature of this new country, but
thought the best part of it lay to the south.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legaspi sailed for Cebu, but when he began to draw
near to the archipelago he sent one of his ships ahead
to learn what sort of welcome the expedition might
look for from the Cebuans. The commander of this
ship brought back a gloomy report. The Cebuans
had not been at all friendly. Instead, they had caught
and killed one of the men of the landing crew from the
ship, and would have killed the others had not the Spanish
pulled off from shore and gone back to their ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this report was brought to Legaspi he was
very sorry. He at once, however, made up his mind
to go to Cebu and subdue the people. This he thought
was his duty toward his king; so the fleet sailed to
Cebu. It came safe into harbor, and the soldiers
landed in front of the town of Cebu on the 27th day of
April, 1565. The Spanish were amazed and delighted
with the beauty and fruitfulness of the island. Weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>with their long voyage, they would gladly have made
friends with the people and been at peace in that lovely
spot.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>ANCIENT FORT COMMANDING CEBU HARBOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The people, however, would not be friends. They
had driven the Spanish from their shore once, and did
not mean that the strangers should come back to live
there. The chief, King Tupas (tö´päs), was a brave
and warlike man, and with a large army he came down
to the shore to beat off the newcomers. A fierce battle
was fought there by the sea, but it did not last
long. The spears and arrows of the Cebuans were of
little use against Spanish armor, while the Spanish firearms
did deadly work among the lightly-clad Cebuan
warriors. After a few hours the Cebuans were forced
back from the shore, and the Spanish held the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legaspi now set to work to win the liking of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Cebuans. He believed firmly that the king of Spain
was by divine right the lawful ruler of these islands;
but for himself, he meant to govern kindly and wisely
in the name of the king. He could not do this until
he had shown the people that he and his soldiers were
their friends. To this task, therefore, he bent all his
wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>So earnestly did the Spanish commander work to
win over the people, that in a very few months the
whole island was in a state of peace. A little later,
Padre Urdaneta went back to Spain to report all that
had been done. King Philip II. was much pleased
with the friar’s report, and made Legaspi “governor-general
of all the territory in the archipelago that he
might conquer for Spain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Matters now went very quietly with the natives for
several years; but trouble came to the Spaniards from
the outside. At this time there was great rivalry between
Spain and Portugal in the discovery and settlement
of new lands. In each of these countries there
were many daring sailors and brave soldiers who liked
nothing better than to go on wild adventures for their
kings, to find and to claim new lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>So great was the rivalry between these two countries
that Pope Alexander VI., soon after the discovery of
America, made a decree dividing between them all the
lands that might be discovered. The dividing line was
the meridian of Cape Verde Island. By his decree
the Pope gave all heathen lands discovered west of
that line to Spain. All the lands that should be discovered
east of the meridian he gave to Portugal.
Under this ruling, as we may see by looking at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>a map, the Philippine Islands would have fallen to
Portugal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spain, however, claimed these islands by right of
discovery, and was ready to uphold her claim by force
of arms. This Legaspi had to do before he had been
long in Cebu. An expedition of Portuguese came out
against the Spanish, and, but for Legaspi’s brave
defense of the island, would have taken it from them.
The Portuguese were forced to retire, however, and
though for years there was much trouble over the
matter, Portugal never made good her claim to the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c007'>By 1570 Legaspi had made the town of Cebu a city
and the seat of government. In the spring of this
year a grandson of his, a young Spanish captain named
Juan Salcedo (säl sā´dō), came from Mexico to help
him in the islands. He was a very young man, but
a good soldier, and wise beyond his years. His grandfather
was glad, indeed, to have such a helper, and
sent him out at the head of a strong force to visit all
the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish had learned by this time about the
island of Luzon that lay to the north, so Salcedo was
ordered to go up there and see what it was like. He
sailed from Cebu early in the summer, and made his
way northward to the great bay of Manila. Here he
found a town called Maynila by the people who lived
there, and here he landed with his company of soldiers,
all in full armor.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MONUMENT TO LEGASPI AT CEBU CITY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The people of Luzon had never before seen European
soldiers. They thought that these were gods,
and not men, and made haste to be friends with them.
They could not understand the firearms which the
soldiers carried, and were much afraid of them. They
gave up their city at once, and brought food and fruits
as offerings to the strange visitors. Salcedo spoke
kindly to them, and when he had made them understand
what he wanted, they all swore loyalty to Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>But Soliman (sō lē´män), chief of Maynila, soon
saw that these huge strangers were only men, after all.
Then he was filled with sorrow to think that he had
given up his city to them, and made up his mind to
win it back. He gathered all his warriors and led
them against the Spanish, but it was of no use. Salcedo’s
forces were too strong for his army, and Soliman
was defeated. He was driven out from his city
again; but this time, rather than let the Spanish have
it, he set fire to it and burned it down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Juan Salcedo now showed himself to be kind as well
as brave. When he had taken Soliman prisoner, he
did not punish him for breaking his oath of fealty to
Spain. He forgave him freely, and let him take the
oath again. Then he let him go on ruling his people
in the name of the king of Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this Salcedo passed on through Luzon, claiming
the country for Philip II. He visited those parts
now known as Laguna (lä gö´nä), Pangasinan (pän gäsē
nän´), and the Camarines (cäm ä rē´nēs). He took the
city of Cainta (kä ēn´tä), where a Moro chief ruled, and
then went to what is now Ilocos Sur (ēl ō´cos sör).
One of his captains, named Martin de Goiti (mär´tin
dā go ē´tē), he left at Maynila with a small force to
guard the camp. Goiti also conquered the people of
Pampanga (päm pän´gä). Later Salcedo sent a messenger
to his grandfather, Governor-General Legaspi,
asking him to come at once to Maynila.</p>

<p class='c007'>During all the time that Salcedo was taking Maynila
and bringing the country under the rule of Spain,
Legaspi was busy in the Visayas (vis ä´yäs). He had
been in the country five years or more, and had done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>much to make peace with the people. The chief of
Cebu had accepted baptism, with many of the Cebuans,
and one of his daughters was married to a Spaniard.
There was great good feeling between the two races,
and the Cebuans looked upon the Spanish as friends.
Well pleased, therefore, with the way things were
going in Cebu, Legaspi went on a tour through all
the Visayan group.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legaspi was at Iloilo on the island of Panay (pän ī´)
when this messenger found him and told him all that
Salcedo had done in Luzon. Legaspi was much
pleased at the news. He saw at once that Maynila
was the place of all others on the islands in which
to set up the government, and he made ready to
go to Luzon. He could do this all the more easily
because of the way he had managed things in the Visayas.
All the native chiefs were still in power, and
Legaspi left them to rule as they had always done,
save that they now ruled in the name of the king of
Spain. The governor-general was able, therefore, to
leave behind him a quiet, orderly government, and
to give his mind freely to the new work before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The journey northward was made in safety, and
early in March of the year 1571, Legaspi and his party
reached Cavite (kä vē´tā). Here they were met by
the Tagal (tā´gäl) chief, Lacondola (lä con dō´lä), rajah
or king of Tondo (ton´dō), who is sometimes also
spoken of as Rajah Matanda (mä tän´dä) or the “old
Rajah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lacondola welcomed Legaspi as the lawful ruler, and
told him that he and his people were loyal to the king of
Spain. The party then went on to Maynila, and here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>also Legaspi was greeted as the king’s representative.
Soliman, the former king of Maynila, was never a really
willing subject of Spain. But he was a nephew of Lacondola,
and the old Rajah’s counsel had great weight
with him; so he never rebelled against the new ruler.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>LEGASPI SAILING TO MANILA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Legaspi now declared King Philip the overlord of
that whole country, and made Maynila the capital.
He changed the spelling of the name to <i>Manila</i>. This
word is made up of two Tagal words—<i>may</i>, which
means “to have,” and <i>nila</i>, a kind of tree that once
grew thickly around the city—and <i>Maynila</i> means that
there were many nila trees there.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Lacondola and Soliman joined forces with Martin de
Goiti, to help strengthen the new rule in the islands.
The country now known as Batangas (bä tän´gäs) Province
was then ruled by several chiefs who were usually
at war with the Tagals and other tribes. They and
their people had come from Borneo and had intermarried
with the Negritos (nā grē´tōs). They were
great hunters and good fighters, but would not yield
to the Spaniards; so, with the aid of other tribes, the
Spaniards drove them from the country. There were
other chiefs ruling in the districts about Manila Bay;
but these showed themselves friendly to Spain, and
were left in office, to govern in the name of the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of putting the country in order now went
on rapidly. In June, 1571, Legaspi formed the City
Council of Manila, and began to lay the foundation for
a wise and just rule in these islands. He made a plan
for Manila, and had the city laid out in squares and
streets just as we see it to-day inside the walls. He
also set the people to work building these walls for a
defense against the wild tribes. The walls were nineteen
years in building, and to-day, after more than
three hundred years, they are still strong and beautiful,
to show how well the Tagal people builded. The
fort at the mouth of the Pasig River was also begun
at this time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Governor-General Legaspi was a strong, wise ruler
for this country. He was a man far ahead of his times
and of his people, “a good man among men, and a
great man among statesmen.” If his plans for the
Philippines had been carried out, the history of the
islands would be very different from what it is to-day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>If those who came after him had been as wise and as
kind as he, the Filipinos would have been a happy,
contented people.</p>

<p class='c007'>But dark days came all too soon to the colony. On
the 20th day of August, 1572, Legaspi died, worn out
by the hard labors of his active, useful life. He was
buried in the Augustine Chapel of San Fausto, in
Manila, and another sort of rule soon began in the
islands.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The <i>Victoria</i>, commanded by Juan Sebastian
del Cano, reached Spain in September, 1522. She was the
first ship to sail around the world. Twenty years later Ruy
Lopez de Villalobos commanded an expedition which went to
Samar. He named this island “Isla Filipina,” and later
Legaspi gave the name “Islas Filipinas” to the entire archipelago.
Miguel de Legaspi commanded an expedition sent
out by King Philip II. to settle in the islands. With him
came the Augustine friar P. Urdaneta. This fleet left Navidad,
Mexico, November 21, 1564. The Spanish went to Cebu,
conquered the people, and then began to make friends with
them and to build up the government. Later the Spanish
had trouble with the Portuguese, who came to claim the
country, but were driven away. In 1570, Juan Salcedo came
out. He went to Luzon, took Maynila, and then sent a
messenger to Legaspi to tell him to come there. Legaspi was
in the Visayas, pacifying the country, but he at once went
to Maynila. He was well received by Lacondola and Soliman,
and set up his capital in Maynila. He formed the City
Council, made a plan for the city, and had work begun on
the walls. He began a wise and humane rule in the islands,
but died, in August, 1572, before he was able to carry out
many of his plans.</p>

Before we go farther with this story of the
Philippines, let us look, for a little while,
at the country itself, and the people who
live in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men who are wise in science tell us that there must
have been in the Pacific Ocean, some thousands of years
ago, a great body of land that has now sunk out of
sight. We do not know when it sank; but after it did
so there must have been, one after another, a great
many volcanic eruptions that broke up the sunken
continent into smaller tracts of land. Many of these
eruptions took place under water, and with the overflow
of lava the separate tracts grew larger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later still this sunken land began slowly to rise from
the sea. In some places this change is still going on.
New islands have come up out of the sea within the
memory of people who are still alive, and there have
been, within modern times, great changes on some of the
Philippine Islands. The whole group is of volcanic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>origin, but there are now very few active volcanoes left
in the country. Of these Mayon (mī ōn´), in the southern
part of Luzon, is the largest. This is said to be
the most beautiful volcano in the world. Its form is a
perfect cone. Taal (tä´äl) volcano, which is on an island
in Lake Bombon (bôm´bôn), is also a famous volcano.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are over 1,200 islands in the archipelago, but
we do not know exactly how many there are. They
have never been counted. Some of them are hardly
more than bits of rock showing above the sea, while
Luzon, the largest, is 480 miles long.</p>

<p class='c007'>On all of the islands there are large mountains.
Great peaks rise, in some cases to a height of 7,000 or
8,000 feet, covered to the very top with forests of
mighty trees. The finest building timber in the world
will some day come from these islands. Teak, ebony,
mahogany, and cedar trees grow here, besides rubber
and camphor trees, and many others for which there
is great demand in all the markets of the world. Fine
fruit trees of many sorts are also found. When there
are good roads in the islands over which to haul logs,
and modern mills and machinery to make them into
lumber, the timber trade of the Philippines will be
a great industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are now about eight millions of people in
the Philippines. How many were here when the
Spanish came we do not know. The larger part of the
people in the islands are of the Malay (mā´lā) race.
These were not the first dwellers in the country, but
came from the Malay Peninsula, and it is likely that
they had not been here more than two or three hundred
years when the Spanish came. They are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>people whose lives and acts make up most of what we
call the “history” of the islands, and they are the
people usually meant by the term “Filipinos.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_044.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>ABORIGINES OF MINDANAO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Up in the mountains, living in nearly as wild a state
as when the Spanish came, we still find the aborigines.
This is a word which means the first dwellers in a country.
It is thought that the first people who lived in
the northern islands were the Aetas, or Negritos. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>race called the Indonesians (in dō nā´sē äns) are the
aborigines of the great island of Mindanao.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Negritos are dying out. They are a small, timid
people, with thick lips and flat noses. Their hair is
like curly wool. They hunt and fight with bows and
arrows, and are very quick and active. Their chief food
is fish, and the brown mountain rice which they plant
and harvest. Even if taken when children and brought
up in a city, they do not grow to like civilized life, but
run away and go back to the mountains as soon as they
have the chance.</p>

<p class='c007'>An important tribe of wild people in these islands
are the Igorrotes (ig ō rō´tēs), of whom there are many
on Luzon. The Igorrotes are the finest and strongest
of all the wild tribes in the country. They are very
brave, and are good fighters, using in warfare a short,
broad knife, which they wield with deadly skill. They
never submitted to the Spaniards, and were badly used
by that people. The Spaniards always made war upon
them, and at one time tried to put an end to all of the
tribe in Luzon. They burned their villages and killed
all who fell in their power. They could not conquer
them, however, and the Igorrotes have always hated
the Spanish fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The civilized Filipino people spring from none of
these wild tribes. As we have said, they are Malays,
and came here from the great Malay Peninsula. The
Malays, from earliest times, were a sea-going folk, daring
sailors, and skillful in managing their boats. They
went boldly to sea in tiny crafts, with only the stars
to guide them, taking risks such as no Europeans dared
to take. They overran the islands of the South Pacific,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>going even as far as the island of Madagascar. They
settled in the Philippines, drove the natives back into
the mountains, and made their homes along the coasts
and on the rich plains. They had a written alphabet
of their own when the Spanish came, and were far
ahead, even then, of the native races.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Malays who settled in the island of Mindanao
were converted to the Moslem faith by some Arabian
missionaries who came to that island as early as the
twelfth or thirteenth century. From Mindanao this
religion was carried to the island of Sulu (sö l´ö), and it
is now the faith of the people of the entire Sulu archipelago.
The people who held to this religion were
called Moros by the Spanish, and by this name they
are still known.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many tribes in the islands, both of the
aborigines and of the Malay people. In early days
these tribes were more separate than at present, and
had little to do with one another, save when there was
war among them. Each had its own language, and
even now a great many dialects are spoken in the
islands. This fact, among others, has helped to keep
the tribes apart and to prevent them from becoming
a strong, united people.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see, from what has been said, that the dwellers
in the Philippine Islands are not strictly a people
in the sense that the Spanish or the English are a
people. Even the Malay folk in the islands have
been, from the very first, split up into many tribes,
having little in common. Under some methods of
government these tribes might have been united;
but Spanish rule was not of a sort to bind them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>together. Rather, it set tribes against one another,
and used some to help conquer others. It did not
draw them together in a strong national life such as
has made the United States of America a great and
powerful nation.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>A MORO OF JOLÓ, IN THE SULU ARCHIPELAGO.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The United States has been settled by people from
many countries. These people have gone to America
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>from nearly every nation on earth; but the different races
have become one strong American people by reason of
a common interest in the good government of their
country, and a common desire for its welfare. Each
State has its own life and government, but all are
united to form the great country of which each is a
part, and to support the Federal Government which
binds the States together.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Filipino people have learned thus to stand
together, a new day will dawn for these islands. When
the people all speak one language, and when young and
old can read and write that language, the country will
be more united, and will begin to know something of
that national life which other countries enjoy. The
people will then be united; they will know how to
govern their land wisely and justly. They will understand,
as they have not done before, the relation one
nation bears to others in the world, and will be able
to develop the great wealth of their country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two great tribes of Malay Filipinos are the Tagals
and the Visayans. The Tagals live in southern Luzon, the
Visayans in the group of islands called the Visayas, which
lie south of Luzon and north of Mindanao. There are,
besides, many lesser peoples in the islands, so that, as
we have seen, there could be no common national life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tribes were governed by great chiefs or kings,
who ruled through small chiefs and dattos. Each of
these was at the head of about a hundred families
whom he stood for in the tribal council, and for whom
he was spokesman before the great chief. The small
chief was called the head of a hundred. It was a
simple, but effective, form of government, and suited
the people. Legaspi and Salcedo made no changes in
it, except to declare the king of Spain the ruler of all
the tribes. They had the great chiefs swear loyalty to
Spain, and then left them to govern for the king.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Later, however, when Legaspi and Salcedo were
gone, many evils crept in. The great chiefs were put
out of power, and little by little self-government was
taken from the people. They came at last to have no
voice in the ordering of their own lives, and no one to
speak for them to their unknown ruler in Spain.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The Philippine Islands are believed to be part
of a great continent that once lay in the South Pacific Ocean.
This continent sank. Afterwards a slow upheaval brought the
islands up from the sea. The Aetas, or Negritos, were the
earliest inhabitants of the country. The Indonesians of Mindanao
are also aborigines. The Igorrotes are a wild tribe of
Luzon and the Visayas, who have from the first been enemies
of Spain. The Spanish treated them cruelly and won their
hatred. The civilized Filipinos are of Malay origin, and
came here from the Malay Peninsula. Those who settled in
Mindanao were converted to the Mohammedan faith in the
twelfth or thirteenth century by Arabian missionaries; and
they are called Moros. The people of the islands are broken
up into many tribes, and this has hindered their becoming a
united people. The tribal form of government was simple,
and so well suited to the country that Legaspi made little
change in it. The Spanish who came after him, however,
took all self-government from the people.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—What are we taught of the origin of the Philippine
Islands? Who are the aborigines? What is the origin
of the civilized Filipinos? How did the Moslem faith come
into the country? Describe the early form of government.</p>

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century,
when Mexico became independent of
Spain, the Philippine Islands were governed
for Spain by that country. This worked
great hardship in the islands. Mexico herself was a
dependency of Spain, and so the Philippines really
became a dependency of a dependency. All laws for
the country were made in Mexico, and in this way
the islanders were removed one step farther from the
foreign ruler who was their king.</p>

<p class='c007'>The High Court of Mexico appointed the governor-general,
and at the same time that it did so named the
man who should succeed him. This it did in order
that there might be no time lost in filling the office
when it became vacant. When Legaspi died, therefore,
his successor was already appointed, and at once
took up the duties of his office.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new governor-general was named Guido de
Lavazares (wē´dō dā lä vä thär´ās), and he was a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>different sort of man from Legaspi. He was more
warlike and less wise, and he liked to meddle in matters
which did not concern him. During his term of
office, he went to the aid of a king of Borneo who had
been dethroned by his rebellious subjects, and helped
the king to regain his throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was so elated with his success in doing this that
he became ambitious. He so far forgot common sense
that he wanted King Philip to let him and his Philippine
forces make war on China and conquer that country
for Spain. He could not have done this, and the
king of Spain was too sensible to let him try. Later,
however, the governor-general had all he wished of
fighting the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Legaspi’s death his grandson, Juan Salcedo,
went on with the work of setting up Spanish rule in
the islands. He passed through the northern part of
Luzon, and wherever he went told the people that
Philip II. was their king. He made it a point always
to make friends with the great chief of any tribe to
which he went. This chief he would win over to swear
fealty to Spain. Then Salcedo would leave him to
rule as before, only in the name of the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>He promised to help the chiefs against their enemies,
and was ready, with his soldiers, to fight their battles
whenever they needed him. In turn he trusted them
to be loyal to the king, and to keep their people from
rebelling. He did not try to improve the country in
any way, or to teach the people anything that would
help them to make it better. His one idea was to win
territory for his king. This, indeed, was all that the
king wanted him to do.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Spain wanted much territory, a wide dominion,
more than she wanted loyal subjects. It was this
greed for power and for wealth that caused her downfall,
and in the end lost for her the rich country which
she had gained at great cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Salcedo, after all, was a far better man and kinder
to the people than were most of those who came after
him. He had much of that wise kindliness which
made Legaspi a good ruler. He took the country by
force, but he was not a tyrant. He did not oppress
the people, nor did he make unwise laws to govern
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made his headquarters in Ilocos Sur, meaning to
rule the northern provinces from there. He had, however,
hardly settled down when news reached him of
a great danger that threatened Manila. Gathering all
his forces he marched southward as fast as his army
could travel, to help Martin de Goiti, who was still in
charge of Manila, to defend the city. It was this same
danger, which so alarmed Salcedo, that gave Guido de
Lavazares his wish to fight the Chinese. It was a most
unexpected danger, and came without warning upon
the colony.</p>

<p class='c007'>At about the time when Legaspi was founding his
capital at Manila, a Chinese pirate named Li-ma-hong
(lē mä hong´) was sailing the waters of the China Sea.
He led a large force of men as lawless as himself, and,
as time went on, he became the terror of sea-going
folk all about there. He grew so bold, and his pirate
fleet so strong, that he dared to attack even the great
war junks of China. At last the Chinese Government
declared him an outlaw, and put a price on his head.
After this the China Sea was not a safe place for him,
so he made up his mind to go somewhere else.</p>

<p>PLAZA DE GOITI, MANILA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>He had captured the crew of a trading junk, and
from these men he learned about the Philippine Islands.
What they told him pleased him so much that he decided
to go to Manila, take the city, and set up a kingdom
of his own on Luzon. He felt certain of success
in this undertaking; for he had a fleet of sixty-two
armed junks and a force of 4,000 fighting men. In
his company were many tradesmen as well as soldiers,
and many women went with the fleet. He also had
plenty of supplies, and Li-ma-hong was sure that, once
he had taken the country, he could set up a colony.</p>

<p class='c007'>He took with him, on his own junk, the crew of the
captured junk, to pilot the way, and with his fleet
sailed for Luzon. In November, 1574, they reached
the north coast of that island. Here some of the
pirates, who went ashore for supplies, sacked and
burned a village and killed many of the Filipinos.
Those who escaped made their way to where Salcedo
was, and told him what had happened. Thus it
came about that the Spanish captain learned of Li-ma-hong’s
scheme before the pirate reached Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving the northern part of Luzon, the Chinese
kept on along the coast toward Manila. Before they
came to the bay, however, the fleet was caught in a
typhoon. Several of the junks and some 200 men
were lost in the storm. Still, Li-ma-hong thought
he had a force strong enough to take Manila, so they
went on. The pirate commander landed an army of
1,500 men before Manila, and sent them up to take
the city.</p>

<p>CHINESE WAR JUNKS ATTACKING MANILA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>They were led by a Japanese named Sioco (sē ō´kō),
whom Li-ma-hong had made his lieutenant, and in a few
hours a savage fight was waging between the Spanish
and the Chinese. The Spanish force was small, but
well armed, and every man knew that he was fighting
for life against a cruel foe. No mercy was to be looked
for from those wild pirates, and no quarter was asked
or given. Even the aged governor-general bore arms
in the fight, for every man was needed. The first
Spaniard killed was brave Martin de Goiti, but he was
not the last. The little garrison was nearly destroyed
before their fortune turned and the pirates were driven
back. The Japanese leader Sioco was killed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>after that the Chinese fell back and reëntered their
junks.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days later Li-ma-hong himself led a second
attack. But meanwhile native troops had been gathered,
and again the pirates were beaten. This time
the fleet retired to the mouth of the Agno River, and
Li-ma-hong set up his kingdom in what is now the
province of Pangasinan. Here the Chinese built temples
and began to plant crops and engage in trade.
They felt very secure, and if they had been let alone
the pirates would no doubt have been prosperous; but
punishment was at hand for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Juan Salcedo, with his soldiers, had reached Manila,
and soon afterwards a war junk from China came into
harbor, looking for Li-ma-hong. This war junk was
sent by the emperor, who had learned of the mischief
the pirate was doing in the Philippines. The captain
had orders to find Li-ma-hong and bring him to justice,
and he meant to do this if he could.</p>

<p class='c007'>The junk joined the Spanish in an expedition by
water, while another force of Spanish and Filipino soldiers
went forward to engage the pirates on land.
When these attacking forces arrived, Li-ma-hong saw
that he must retreat for his life, so he played a trick
upon the enemy and upon some of his own soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>He told off some of his men to go forward against
the enemy, and make the latter believe that they were
the main body of the Chinese. The trick was successful.
When the Spanish and native troops made the
attack, the pirates, after a show of fighting, began to
fall back toward the mountains. The enemy gave
chase and furnished Li-ma-hong the chance for which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>he was watching. With all his fleet he slipped down
the river, keeping under cover of the reeds and tall
grass, gained the sea and fled, leaving his soldiers at
the mercy of the foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chinese thus meanly deserted by their leader
did not wait to be killed, but retreated in earnest to
the mountains. Here they took refuge with the Igorrotes,
and here they spent the rest of their lives. They
married women from among the Igorrotes, and from
them are descended those people who are to-day known
as the Igorrote-Chinese.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was some time before peace and a sense of safety
were restored in Manila. Work was pushed more rapidly
on the city walls, which were still building, and
upon Fort Santiago. Other troops of Spanish were
sent from Mexico to make the defense of the city
stronger, but long before they came Salcedo went back
to his work in the north. He died of fever in Ilocos
Sur a year or two later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Salcedo was still a young man, but twenty-seven
years old, at the time of his death (March 11,
1576). Had he lived longer, he would doubtless have
become a great statesman, for he showed much tact
and wisdom in his dealings with the people. He
was honestly mourned by both the Spanish and the
native soldiers of his army. A few years after his
death, his bones were brought to Manila and laid to
rest beside those of his grandfather, Miguel de Legaspi.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—Up to the beginning of the nineteenth century
the Philippine Islands were governed as a dependency of
Mexico. The High Court of Mexico named the governor-general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and made laws for the country. Legaspi was succeeded
by Guido de Lavazares. After Legaspi’s death Salcedo
went to Ilocos Sur to carry on his work of subjecting the
country to Spain. In 1574 the Chinese pirate Li-ma-hong
made an attack on Manila, meaning to take the city and set
up a kingdom there. Driven back from the city, he retreated
to the mouth of the Agno River and settled there with his
pirate band. A Chinese war junk came to the help of the
Spanish, and Li-ma-hong was forced to flee. He escaped,
deserting some of his own soldiers whom he had sent inland.
In 1576 Juan Salcedo died in Ilocos Sur.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
For the first two hundred years, as we have
said, the Spanish colony in the Philippines
was governed from Mexico. A Supreme
Court, or Audencia, like that of Mexico, was
set up in Manila. This court tried cases and settled
law questions for the whole archipelago. The Mexican
code of law was in force here, and the officials in
the islands tried to make the government as much as
possible like that of Mexico.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, however, was a very different country from
Mexico. The Filipinos were a very different people
from the native Mexicans. What worked well, therefore,
for one country and one people, did not suit
at all for the other. Often, in these islands, right and
justice were hindered by the very laws made to help
them. The men who framed these laws did not know
the islands or the Filipinos, so they could not understand
why the code that was good for Mexico should
fail here.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Soon still other troubles arose. The rulers who
came after Legaspi did away, one by one, with the
native forms of government. There were no longer
any tribal councils in which the heads of groups could
speak for their people. The native kings and chiefs
were set aside, and the people then had no representatives.
There was nothing to check the power of the
governor-general. He had full control over the lives
and liberties of the people, and no one could call him
to account but the king of Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In name the ancient office of head of a hundred
still lived in the office of “cabeza de barangay” (cäbā´thä
dā bär än’gī), which the Spanish kept up. The
office itself, however, was no longer high or honorable.
The chief duty of the cabeza de barangay came to be
the raising of money among the people for the government.
If the people were poor, if times were bad, if
the crops had failed, still this money must be raised.
The government looked to the barangay chief to get
it, in one way or another. Often, when the people
were unable to pay, his property was taken, and many
a headman of a village was stripped of all he had by
the officers of government. In time, therefore, the
office fell into such disgrace that no self-respecting
Filipino would take it. At last a law had to be passed
compelling service as cabeza de barangay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very early in the history of the colony there began
to be strife among the Spanish authorities. The bitter
misunderstanding between Church and State arose
almost at once, and it continued through all the years
of Spanish rule in the islands. Soon after its formation,
the Supreme Court, too, became a party in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>quarrels of the powers. Each of these three parties
was determined to control matters, and the result was
very bad for the colony. At times, indeed, the quarrel
was so sharp that affairs in the country were at
a standstill, and ruin threatened the colony.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>KING PHILIP II.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>So matters went on until the year 1587, when they
became so bad that
the Bishop of Manila
sent a secret messenger
to Spain to lay
complaint before the
king. This messenger
was a friar named
Alonzo Sanchez (älon´thō
sän’cheth). He
went first to Mexico
and laid his case before
the viceroy, who
sent him on to Spain.
There he gained a
hearing from King
Philip II., who promised
to look into the
matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king then put the case in charge of one of his
ministers, who studied it with great care, and at last
made a report which was the basis of a royal decree.
In this decree the king gave attention to a good many
things that were wrong in the islands, and made some
definite laws in regard to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decree did away altogether with the Supreme
Court, and appointed justices of the peace in its place.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>It set forth plainly just what should be the field of
action of the State and what of the Church. It gave
the governor-general full power to do as he liked in
matters regarding all distant and unexplored parts of
the country. In what he did in such places he need
not consult even the king’s will. If, however, he wished
to undertake a war, or any expedition that must be
paid for out of the royal treasury, he must first submit
his plans to a council made up of the Bishop of Manila
and the chief military captains in the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decree also forbade the making of any more
slaves in the islands. All slaves held by Spaniards
were to be set free at once. All between the ages of
ten and twenty years, held by Filipinos, were to be
freed at the latter age, and all over twenty years old
were to be set free in five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrangement was made for a tribute to be raised
from among the people. The money so gathered was
to be divided in a fixed ratio between the Church, the
State, and the army. All begging friars—and of these
many had come to the country—were ordered to leave
the Philippines, and forty Augustine friars were sent
out to Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new governor-general was sent to the islands,
with instructions to carry out the decree. This official
was Don Gomez Perez Desmarinas (gö meth´ pā reth´
des mär ē´näs). He was a man of great energy and
force of character, and no doubt meant to be just and
fair. He did not, however, get along well with the
Bishop of Manila, and before long the trouble between
Church and State broke out again. This time the
bishop decided to go, himself, to Spain, and see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>whether some understanding could not be had by
which peace could be kept.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bishop Salazar (säl ä thär´) was then seventy-eight
years old. He was an Augustine friar, and had been
parish priest of Manila. In 1581, when Pope Gregorio
XIII. founded the See of Manila, Salazar was made
bishop; but he now felt that the Church must have
still greater authority in the islands. One object of
his visit to Spain was to get the consent of the king
and of the Pope that Manila should be made an archbishopric.
In this he succeeded. The Pope issued a
bull dated August 14, 1595, creating the Archbishopric
of Manila, and Salazar was made the first archbishop.
He died, however, before official notice reached him
of his new dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>News traveled slowly in those days, but in the
course of time the emperor of Japan heard that a colony
of Europeans had settled in the Philippine Islands.
He seems to have thought that Japan had some interest
in these islands; for in 1593 he sent an ambassador
to Manila. The name of this ambassador was Farranda
Kieman (fä rän´dä kī ā´män).</p>

<p class='c007'>His coming was the cause of some anxiety to the
Spanish. As soon as he landed in Manila he waited
upon Governor-General Desmarinas with his message.
This was a demand upon the Spanish in the Philippines
to surrender, and to declare themselves to be
vassals of Japan. If they did not do this, Kieman
told Desmarinas, the emperor would send war junks
to take the country by force.</p>

<p class='c007'>To all this the governor-general replied with great
politeness, but very firmly. He told the ambassador
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>that he and the other Spanish colonists were already
subjects of a great king, in whose name he ruled, and
that he could not yield the country to Japan. At the
same time his king wished to be on good terms with
the emperor, whose power and greatness were so well
known, and the governor-general hoped a treaty could
be made between the two rulers. Such a treaty, he
pointed out, would be a great help to both countries.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE CITY WALL AND MOAT, MANILA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Farranda Kieman thought that all this was reasonable,
and soon afterwards envoys were sent from Manila
to the court of Japan. They were well received, and
a treaty was made for trade and mutual defense between
Japan and the Philippines. However, the ship on
which the envoys were returning home was wrecked,
and they and the treaty were lost.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>In May, 1593, another envoy, Fray Pedro Bautista
(pā´drō bä ö tēs´tä), was sent to Japan, and a new
treaty was made. A copy of this was sent back to
Manila, but the friar envoy asked permission to stay
in Japan. His request was granted; he stayed in
Japan, and began preaching to the people. Some
years later the fruit of this act, which at the time
seemed so slight, came back to Manila in a way most
unexpected.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime Governor-General Desmarinas was
busy in Manila. He was anxious to see the city walls
finished, and kept the people at work on this great
task. The fort at the mouth of the river was completed,
and the walls of the city already made a noble showing.
The Cathedral of Manila and the Santa Polenciana
(sän´tä pō len´sē ä´nä) College of Orphans were
built, and many other good buildings were completed.
Desmarinas had also brought the provinces of Zambales
(thäm bä´lēs) and the Camarines under Spanish
rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the autumn of 1593, a native king of Fernate
(fer nä´tē), one of the Molucca Islands, came to Manila
to ask for help against the Dutch sailors who made
trouble on his island. Desmarinas gathered a large
fleet, and on October 6th started with the native king
for Fernate. While on the way, the Chinese oarsmen
on the governor-general’s galley rose in revolt one
night, took the galley, and killed the governor-general.
Some of the Spanish troops on board escaped by jumping
overboard. After the death of Desmarinas, the
Chinese put the rest of the Spanish ashore and went
off with the galley.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>This sad event broke up the expedition. The fleet
returned to Manila and Don Luis (lö´is) Perez Desmarinas,
a son of the dead official, took up the government.
He ruled quietly until 1596, when his successor,
Don Francisco Tello de Guzman (frän sēs´kō
tėl´lō dā gäth´män), came to Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1598, King Philip II. of Spain being
dead, his son, King Philip III., again set up the
Supreme Court in Manila. This was done with great
pomp and show. There was a long procession in the
streets of Manila, and high civic and religious ceremonies.
The court was given the same powers as the
court of Mexico and of Lima, in Peru, and during
Spanish rule was never again done away with.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The code of laws by which Mexico was ruled
was made the code of the Philippines as well. This arrangement
was not a good one. The ruler who came after Legaspi
did away with the native chiefs and kings. Only the office
of head of a hundred was left, and that had so little honor
that no self-respecting Filipino cared to take it. Early in
the history of the colony began the strife between authorities
which, during the rule of Spain, caused most of the trouble in
the colony. At last Bishop Salazar of Manila sent a messenger
to Spain. The result was a royal decree defining the
official field of the State and of the Church. Gomez Perez
Desmarinas was made governor-general, and came to Manila.
He did not get along well with the Bishop of Manila, and
later the bishop went, himself, to Spain. He succeeded in
getting Manila made an archbishopric, and was himself appointed
archbishop, but died before the official notice reached
him. In 1593 the emperor of Japan sent an ambassador to
Manila to demand tribute from the Spanish colony. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the governor-general declined to give, but a treaty was made
with Japan. In that same year the king of Fernate came to
Manila seeking help against the Dutch. Governor-General
Desmarinas raised a fleet to go to Fernate, but while on the
way was killed by the Chinese oarsmen on board his galley.
His son Luis Perez Desmarinas succeeded him in office
until 1596, when a new governor-general came out. In 1598
the Supreme Court was again set up by order of King Philip
III. of Spain.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—What code of laws was put in use in the Philippines?
What changes in government did Legaspi’s successors
make? Why did Bishop Salazar send a messenger to Spain?

From now on trouble came thick and fast
upon the Spanish colony in the Philippines.
Some of it was due to the wild and troubled
times through which all the civilized world
was passing, but most of it was caused by the short-sighted
folly of the home government.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1599, when Antonio Morga (än tō´nē ō mor´gä)
was governor-general, the first real attempt was made
to occupy Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago. For
this purpose an expedition started from Manila under
the leadership of Estevan Roderigues (es´tā vän rō dārēg´ēs),
a Portuguese nobleman, who had received permission
from Spain to set up a colony in Mindanao.
He was to be governor of that island, and, from his
headquarters there, was to try to conquer the Moros
of Sulu, who had never submitted to Spain’s rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>This expedition was a sad mistake, and failed from
the beginning. The Mindanao Mohammedans resisted
all efforts of the Spanish to land, and Roderigues lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>his life in the very first battle. His body was taken to
Manila for burial. Several other expeditions were sent
out, from time to time, to punish the Moros and force a
settlement upon the island; but none of them succeeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The efforts of the Spanish only aroused the anger
and hatred of these people. For two hundred and fifty
years after that Moro pirates harried the shores of all
the islands where the Spanish dwelt. They killed and
robbed both Europeans and Filipinos; they burned
towns and villages, and carried off the people to be
their slaves. For fear of them the coasts were deserted.
No one dared live near the sea; fishermen
dared not follow their calling, nor farmers till their
fields. Traders dared not come to the island ports to
buy or to sell, and the coastwise trade of the country
was all but ruined.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the Spanish were busy trying to gain a foothold
in the south, there came to Manila two visitors
who were the innocent cause of still more trouble in
the country. These were two high mandarins of China,
who reached the city in the year 1603. Their story
was that the emperor of China had heard that there
existed, near the city of Cavite, a great mountain of
pure gold. The emperor, they said, could hardly
believe this to be true; so he had sent them to see
this mountain, that they might come back and tell
him about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time Bravo de Acuña (brä´vō dā ä kön yä)
was governor-general. He received the mandarins
politely, and sent them with an escort to Cavite, to
see for themselves that no such mountain was there.
The visitors were royally entertained during their stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>in Manila, and at last went home with their report to
their emperor.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>A MEMBER OF THE GUIANGA TRIBE OF MINDANAO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This visit caused a great fright in Manila, for the
Spanish at once
suspected that
there was a plot
behind it for the
Chinese to seize
the city. They
believed, or pretended
to believe,
that the
mandarins had
come merely to
spy out the land
and prepare the
way. At once
the city was
made ready
against invasion.
The garrisons
were increased,
new
ones were
formed, and
every Spaniard
armed himself.
The Filipinos
were much excited
over the stories told of coming trouble; while
the Chinese, suspected and insulted by all, could not
but understand that some danger threatened them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>At last the Chinese, wild with fear, took matters
into their own hands. They began to fortify places
outside the city, and one evening opened the battle by
firing upon some Filipinos inside the city walls. They
followed up this act by crossing the river and making
a savage attack on Binondo (bē nón´dō), then only a
small village on the river bank. After that they gathered
their forces at Tondo, and kept up the siege of
Binondo all that night.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>WARRIORS OF MINDANAO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Next morning a strong force of Spanish marched
out against them. This force was led by Luis Perez
Desmarinas, and in it were the pick of all the young
Castilian gentlemen in the country. The best of the
Spanish soldiery were there also, as well as a body of
native troops. These troops were Pampangans, who
were then the best trained of the Filipino soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand were thousands of frightened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Chinese, ready to fight to the death, and there was
awful work in the streets of Binondo that day. Neither
side gave or got any quarter, and by night, of
all those brave young Spanish gentlemen scarce one
was left alive.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at last the Chinese gave way. They had neither
weapons to carry on war, nor food to help them withstand
a siege. They began, therefore, to fall back
toward the interior; but they were hotly chased, and
as they fled nearly 25,000 of them were killed. It was
sad business, and all the more sad because it is likely that
neither side really knew what the fighting was about.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides trouble with the Moros in the south and
with the Chinese in the north, the colony had much to
bear from Spain’s old-time foe, the Dutch. At this
time there were really very few Spanish in the islands.
There had been less than a thousand when the battle
with the Chinese was fought. Many were killed on
that fatal day, so that in the new trouble the Spaniards
would have fared ill, had it not been that the
army of the colony now numbered many Filipino soldiers
in its ranks.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the end of the sixteenth century down to the
year 1763, there was war between Spain and the Dutch,
and this war caused much hardship in the islands. It
was Spain’s short-sighted method in dealing with her
colonies to restrict their trade whenever it was likely
to interfere with that of her home merchants. So
harsh were the measures by which she held in check
the trade of her colonies that she kept all her dependencies
poor, so that in the end the mother country lost
more than she gained.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>At this time the Philippine merchants were allowed
to trade only with Mexico. Once a year, usually in
July, a state galleon left Manila carrying goods to that
country. The goods were sold in Mexico, and the
money and other goods were sent back by galleon
to Manila.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>DUTCH SHIPS ATTACKING A CHINESE TRADING JUNK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The galleons also carried the mail, and great sums
of money which Mexico sent over to meet the expenses
of the island government. They were always rich
prizes, and Spain’s enemies knew this all too well.
They would lie in wait for them, to capture and despoil
them. The Dutch ships, in particular, often did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>this. From first to last they captured a good many
of the royal galleons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every capture meant calamity to the islands. It
meant for Manila merchants the loss of a whole year’s
business. To the State and to the Church it meant
loss of income, of salaries, and of money to carry on
all public work. To the natives it meant harder and
longer tasks, deeper poverty, heavier burdens which
they must endure in raising the extra tribute, and
heavier taxes by which the loss was made good.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a hundred and fifty years there was fighting
over the royal galleons. At one time, when Spain
and England were at war, there were six years during
which no galleon reached Manila. The country was
in such sore straits that even the Chinese revolted,
and the Spanish were nearly starved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spain, however, seemed to learn no lesson from these
experiences. She went on as of old, sending one galleon
a year, richly laden, at the mercy of the enemy, “putting
all her eggs into one basket,” as the saying is, and
when the “one basket” came to mishap all was lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides keeping a lookout for the galleons, the Dutch
ships were wont to lie in wait outside Manila harbor,
to catch Chinese and Japanese trading junks
coming into port. In this way they often captured
rich prizes, and made still greater drain upon the
islands. It was necessary for the colony to raise large
sums of money and many bodies of fighting men to go
against these ships in order to protect the harbor from
them. Many battles were fought with the Dutch in
Philippine waters, and many times the efforts of the
natives brought victory to the Spanish side.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>But it was a hard and bitter experience. The colony
lived in a state of constant danger and of real
want from this source. Not until the middle of the
eighteenth century, when peace was made with Holland,
had the people of these islands any security of
life or commerce.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—In 1599 the first real attempts were made to
settle in Mindanao. An expedition was sent south, but failed,
and its leader was killed. The Spanish only stirred up the
Moros against themselves, so that the pirates came north and
laid waste the coast towns. In 1603 two Chinese mandarins
came to Manila, looking for a mountain of gold which they
had heard was near Cavite. This visit awakened a fear that
the Chinese meant to seize Manila, and the city was made
ready against invasion. The Chinese of Manila were driven
by abuse to make an attack on some natives, and the Spanish
then fell upon them, killing over 25,000. The Spanish themselves
lost the pick of their soldiers and cavaliers that day.
Owing to Spain’s war with the Dutch, the islands at this time,
and for many years after, suffered great losses and hardships.
The Dutch used to lie in wait to capture the galleons that
carried merchandise and money back and forth between Manila
and Mexico. Whenever a galleon was lost, the whole
country suffered; but the weight fell heaviest upon the natives,
who, by extra tribute and taxes, had to make the loss good.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—Tell about the first expedition to settle Mindanao.
What did the Moros do to avenge what they deemed
Spanish invasion? Give an account of the battle against the
Chinese. What led up to this battle? How was trade carried
on between the islands and Mexico? What was the result of
the capture of a galleon by Spain’s enemies? Why was Spain’s
restriction of her colonies’ trade a bad thing for her?</p>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_078.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
At the time when Spain took the Philippine
Islands and began to rule them, every
country in Europe was busy setting up colonies
in the newly discovered parts of the
world. If the king owed something to a troublesome
subject, or wished to reward or please a favorite, an
easy way to pay the debtor or help the favorite was
to make him a governor or other official in some far-off
new colony. In turn the governor thought it only fair
to make his colony as profitable to the Crown as he
could. That he had no right to oppress other peoples
in order to do this was a matter about which he
never thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hard for us, who live in an age when the rights
of man are upheld, to remember that there was once a
time when no one in power thought very much about
these rights. Statesmen had not then learned that a
mother country owes a duty to her colonies. They
thought only of the help that a colony should give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>toward supporting the home government. England
for many years held this idea about America. She
put great hardships upon her colonies there. She
taxed them very unjustly, and put unfair limits to their
trade. The Americans, however, knew that no government
had a right to oppress even its own colonies.
When the king of England went too far in his unjust
rule, the people rebelled. They threw off the yoke
of England just as, some years later, Mexico threw off
the yoke of Spain, and became independent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Philippine Islands suffered beyond what was
the usual fate of colonies, even at that time. They
were far out of the regular routes of ocean travel.
The people there knew nothing at all of the ideas of
human liberty that were even then setting the world
thinking. Then, too, they were ruled by a people
who were behind the rest of the world in accepting
these ideas. Spain, blinded by her own pride and
folly, has been slowest of all European nations to listen
to the gospel of human rights. She ruled her colonies
cruelly long after other nations came to see that they
owed a duty to their dependencies, and as a result
Spain lost her colonies at just the time when she most
needed their help.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Philippines, moreover, were not ruled from
Spain direct. They were, as has been said, a dependency
of Mexico, and Mexico was in turn a dependency
of Spain. It happened, therefore, that even when the
islands had officials who might have been glad to help
the people, these officials were themselves in a hard
place. They had two masters over them. Spain
looked to Mexico for the royal dues from the islands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and Mexico, in turn, looked to the governor-general,
who must see to it that his colony was profitable to
the Crown.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, we see, there was a great burden laid upon the
archipelago, and this burden the people had to carry.
For three hundred and eighty years the Filipinos were
subjects of Spain. They submitted to her rule because
there was never a time when, without outside
help, they could throw off that rule. But they never
were, in their hearts, willing subjects. During all the
time the Spanish were in the islands there was never
a very long period when the people were not somewhere
in revolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Luzon, on Bohol (bō hōľ), on Samar, Leyte
(lā´ē tā), Mindanao, and in the Sulu Islands, there was
one uprising after another during the seventeenth
century. In Cebu it was needful, always, for Spain to
keep a strong armed force, and it was often necessary
to send the troops from Cebu to put down trouble in
the other islands. The love of liberty dies hard from
the human heart; and while there was at no time a
general revolt of the people, the frequent revolts of
different tribes kept the Spanish busy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet at no time did the Filipinos go to war to gain
national independence. They were not united enough
for that. It is a part of the pity of it all that this
should have been so. It is sad to think of all the suffering
and want the people bore, and of all the lives
that were lost in their small battles. It is sadder still
to remember that the aim of these battles was not to
win independence from Spain, but to secure only such
decent treatment as is the right of every human being.</p>

<p>FUERZA DEL PILAR, MINDANAO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>It will be remembered that the friar whom Governor-General
Desmarinas sent to make a treaty with Japan
stayed in that country. He set up missions there, and
both he and other friars who came over from Manila
preached to the people. In time the emperor learned
of this. He asked about the new teachers, and was told
that this was Spain’s way of getting a hold on another
country. Spanish friars would go into a country to
teach the people religion, and later Spain would send
her soldiers to protect the friars and their converts.
After that, his advisers told the emperor, it was only a
matter of time when Spain would come to rule the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor was alarmed to hear all this. He ordered
the friars back to Manila, and forbade any one to
teach Christianity in his country. The missionary friars
defied him, however, and later some were put to death
with their Japanese converts. But other friars came
from Manila, and in 1633 the emperor became angry,
and did a dreadful thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>He gathered in his own country a band of 150 people
who were lepers. He loaded them into a ship and
sent them to Manila. The commander of the ship
bore to the governor-general a message which made
a sensation in Manila. The message set forth the fact
that the emperor did not allow Christians to come to
Japan. Since, however, the priests of Manila seemed
very fond of such people as these lepers, he sent this
shipload as a present to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may imagine the rage of the Manila officials
over this “present.” Some of them were for taking the
ship outside the harbor and sinking her with her load.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Others advised sending her back to Japan. The friars,
however, to whom the lepers had been sent, claimed
them. They begged the governor-general to have
mercy on the poor creatures, and at last he relented.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>ST. LAZARUS HOSPITAL, MANILA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The lepers were brought ashore with much ceremony,
and kept in Manila. As soon as possible a hospital
was built for them, and they were taken to it.
This hospital was named St. Lazarus Hospital. It
still exists in Manila, though the present building is
not the one put up for those first lepers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In putting down the revolts of the people against
tyranny, the Spanish had, from time to time, lost
many troops. Many were also killed in the great battle
with the Chinese, of which we have read, and in
the wars with the Moros still other Spanish lives were
lost. The Moro pirates from the south were a source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of great danger, as we have already seen. In 1635 the
Spanish were forced to build a fort at Zamboanga (sämbō än´gä)
to keep these pirates in check. Garrisons
were also stationed at several places in Sulu for the
same purpose. The Spanish, however, never really
controlled the Sulu archipelago. The soldiers were
never safe more than a day’s march from their forts,
and they lived in constant danger of attack from the
Moros.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one way and another the army of the colony was
much weakened, and an uprising of the Chinese, in
1634, made great trouble. This uprising took place
in Laguna Province. Enraged by official oppression
30,000 Chinese rose in rebellion. So strong were they,
that they held their own against the Spanish for nearly
a year. Indeed, they might not have been conquered
at all but for the help of the native troops, who fought
with the Spanish. Over 6,000 Chinese were killed in
this revolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>In November 1645, happened one of the worst
earthquakes Manila has ever known. Every public
building in the city, save one monastery and two
churches, was destroyed. The governor-general nearly
lost his life in the wreck of his palace, and over 600
people were killed in Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>It became necessary to rebuild the city, and then
the Spanish found that there was a great lack, not
only of soldiers, but of laborers. The need became so
great that, in 1649, Governor-General Diego Fajardo
(dē ā´gō fä häŕdō) made a bad mistake. He began
to force the people into military service, and also compelled
them to work upon the arsenal at Cavite.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The people had borne much. Patient as they were,
this injustice was more than they would endure, and
they became deeply angry. Rebellion spread like
wildfire through a number of the islands, and there
was almost, though not quite, a general revolt. It
began on Samar, and was led by a Filipino named
Sumoroy (sö mō roy´). At the head of a large force he
attacked the Spanish and the friars. He led his army
down the coast of Samar, burning towns and churches.
Many of the priests and Spanish on the island were
killed, and the rebellion grew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Troops were at once sent out against the rebels, and
the governor of Samar sent messengers to demand
Sumoroy’s head. The messengers did not return, but
the rebels sent back the head of a pig to the governor.
The revolt spread to other islands. Soon the people
of Masbate (mäs bä´tē) and Leyte, of Cebu, Caraga
(cä rä´gä) and Zamboanga, were in arms. The trouble
even reached Manila, and the officials there became
alarmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Governor-General Fajardo had not dreamed that his
act of injustice would work so much mischief. Now,
greatly concerned, he sent General Lopez Azaldegin
(ä thäl´dā gin) to Samar. This officer had all the forces
that could be raised, and full authority to put down
the rebels as he saw fit.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great many battles were fought up and down
Samar, and at last Sumoroy was driven back into the
mountains. The Spanish carried on the war with savage
cruelty. They severely punished all rebels whom
they caught, and showed mercy to none. When they
found that Sumoroy had escaped to the mountains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>they raided his home and tortured his mother to
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>By such outrages they hoped to frighten the people
into submission. By threats and torture they tried to
make his people betray Sumoroy, and at last they
succeeded. He was captured and turned over to the
enemy. General Azaldegin had the rebel leader’s head
struck off and stuck upon a pole. It was then sent
about among the islands to teach the people what
treatment rebels might expect from Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the rebellion was quelled for a time. The
people had gained nothing by it, but it had kindled
a fire in their hearts. This fire was not quenched; it
only waited, hidden, ready to blaze up again when the
right moment should come.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The early idea of a colony was that it should
be only a source of income to the mother country. This idea
was held by other countries than Spain; but Spain clung to
the idea long after other nations gave it up. She did not
listen to the gospel of the rights of man, and in time she lost
most of her colonies. Her policy in the Philippines kept
the natives rebellious. For three hundred and eighty years
the Filipinos were ruled by her, but in their hearts they never
consented to that rule. There was one revolt after another,
the people trying by this means to gain decent treatment.
In 1633, angered by the efforts of friars to convert his people,
the emperor of Japan sent a “present” to the priests at
Manila. This “present” was a shipload of 150 lepers.
After some debate the priests persuaded the governor-general
to let the lepers land, and St. Lazarus Hospital was built for
them. The colony was now much weakened by wars, and in
1634 a revolt of the Chinese in Laguna was nearly successful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>It was only put down by native help. The great earthquake
of 1645 nearly destroyed Manila, and 600 people were killed
in the city. Laborers and soldiers were now so scarce that
Governor-General Fajardo tried to compel the people to serve
in the army and work on the arsenal at Cavite. This led to
a revolt which took all the forces the Spanish could muster
to put it down.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—What was the early idea of what a colony
should be? How were the American colonies driven to
revolt? How did Spain treat her colonies? Why did not
the islands throw off her yoke? Why did the Japanese emperor
send lepers to Manila? What caused the rebellion on
Samar? Who led it? How was it put down?</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_088.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The story of the colony at this time is a sad
one. Bad management, dishonesty, and
cruelty at last brought the country to such
a pass that both Mexico and Spain were
weary. The king even thought of giving up the colony,
hopeless of ever receiving any benefit from it. The
islands were a drain upon the treasury rather than a
help to it, and it looked as if things would never be
any better.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1653, however, a new beginning was
planned. The country was to be given another chance.
To this end a new governor-general and a new archbishop
were sent out from Mexico. These two men,
it was thought, could work peacefully together. It was
hoped that they would bring better days to the islands.
The governor-general, Sabinino Manrique de Lara (säbē
nē´nō män´rēk dā lä´rä), was an honest, pious man.
The new archbishop was wise and just, and seems to
have had a sincere desire to help the country.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>The archbishop was charged by the Pope with the
task of cleansing the land from the evil acts that had
made so much sorrow. When the ship reached Manila,
before any one else was allowed to land, the archbishop
went ashore. He landed alone, knelt at once, and
blessed the soil. The governor-general then landed,
and prayers were offered for the good of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some days afterwards, in the open air, outside the
city walls, a solemn service was held. Archbishop
Problete (prō blā´ tā) then went through the ceremony
of purifying the land. He blessed the colony and declared
it clean of all the evil done there. From that
day peace and good-will were to be upon all the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this, things went better for several years.
There was peace and good understanding between
Church and State, so that both worked for the good
of the country. Governor-General Lara allowed the
archbishop a voice in matters of State, and yielded
to him in many ways. He even permitted him to veto,
or forbid, orders which the governor-general himself
approved. These privileges the Churchman seems not
to have abused.</p>

<p class='c007'>But more than mere words and public services were
needed to cleanse the land. Evil and oppression had
worked wrong that was not to be undone in any easy
way. The rebellion of 1649 was not yet forgotten,
nor were there lacking people ready to make trouble
to gain their own ends. Here and there, every little
while, conflict broke out anew, but always in a small
way. It was never grave enough to cause fear in
Manila. It was enough, however, to keep the people
restless, and the Spanish soldiers on the alert.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The commander of the Spanish forces in the Visayas
was Captain Gregorio de Castillo. Weary of putting
down the frequent small revolts, he at last hit upon a
plan to end the trouble. He issued a notice promising
that all rebels who would come into camp and lay down
their arms would be forgiven.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of past lessons, many of the Filipinos trusted
to this promise. A large number of them came and
gave up their weapons. When too late they saw what
a mistake they had made. They were taken to Manila
as prisoners, and were not pardoned. Instead, most
of them were punished. Some were put to death;
others were sent to the galleys; only a few were set
free.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may be sure that the memory of this false dealing
rankled in the hearts of the people. In 1660 rebellion
broke out with fresh force. This time the
Pampangans were in the uprising. This people had
from the first been loyal to Spain. They were among
the best of her native soldiers, and had always helped
to keep her enemies out of the country. For reward
the government set them, with many others, to cutting
timber for the arsenal. This work all were compelled
to do without pay.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Pampanga the revolt swept through other
provinces of Luzon. It took more definite shape than
any other uprising had done, and gained strength. A
Filipino named Malong was at the head of the movement.
He was a real leader, and he at once began
to raise an army. The Ilocans and Cacaygans joined
him, and in a little while 40,000 men had been enrolled.
They were not well armed, nor were they well supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>with food; but they marched through the country,
making war on the Spanish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, however, effort failed because it was not
united. The tribes could not grasp the idea of real
union. The people had no clear thought of a national
life together. So they fought among themselves as
well as against the common enemy, and their warfare
came to naught. They could not long resist the
trained Spanish troops, and in time the rebellion was
put down. The army was scattered, and its leaders
became outlaws in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Governor-General Lara was in office another
Chinese invasion threatened. A Mongol chief named
Koxinga (kox in´gä), who had been driven from his
own country by the Tartars, was the leader of it.
When the Tartars overran China, about the middle of
the seventeenth century, Koxinga and many of his
followers refused to submit. They went to Formosa,
drove out the Dutch people, and settled there. Later
Koxinga laid a plan to take the Philippine Islands and
set up his kingdom there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Koxinga’s chief adviser was an Italian friar named
Riccio (rē´ chē ō). This friar he had made a high mandarin,
or nobleman. He now sent him to Manila,
dressed in the garb of his office, to demand tribute
from the Philippine Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally this demand caused amaze and alarm in
Manila. The Spaniards were aghast at the idea of
a Catholic priest demanding tribute from a Catholic
country, in the name of a heathen ruler. Later the
authorities at Rome called the friar to account for his
conduct. At this time, however, the Spanish were at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>a loss how to act. They did not dare send the priest-mandarin
away, nor could they give him any answer.
They therefore kept him waiting in Manila while they
made up their minds what to do.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_093.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE MANILA CATHEDRAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As was usual, when trouble arose, the government
thought that the Chinese in Manila were plotting to
take the city. They felt sure that these men would be
ready to help Koxinga when he came, so everything
was made ready for another attack upon the Chinese
in Luzon.</p>

<p class='c007'>All government troops, both Spanish and native,
were collected at Manila. The forts at Yligan (ē´lēgän),
at Calamianes (cäl ä mē än´ēs), and at Zamboanga,
were torn down and the soldiers brought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Luzon. Only the fort at Caraga, Mindanao, was left
standing. This one they did not dare to give up; the
soldiers there were all that kept the Moros from destroying
the settlements on that coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Chinese saw the Spaniards making ready
for war, they knew from past experience that it meant
trouble for them. As usual, therefore, they began the
trouble themselves. They attacked the Spanish, and
the latter at once began fighting the Chinese wherever
they found them.</p>

<p class='c007'>This time the Spanish meant to kill every Chinaman
in the country. They hunted out all who hid, and cut
them down. Not one whom they caught was spared.
Not one of all in the islands would have been spared
if the country could have gotten along without them.
Some one remembered, however, before it was too
late, that if all the Chinese were killed there would
be no one left to carry on the small trades of the country.
Because bootmakers and tailors and small shopkeepers
were needed, therefore about 5,000 Chinamen
were spared, and these were permitted to remain in
Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>After peace was made, Riccio was allowed to go back
to Formosa, to tell Koxinga what had been done. He
found the chieftain getting ready to come to Manila
with an army to take the country, and Riccio told him
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Koxinga’s rage was great when he heard his mandarin’s
story. He planned to go at once to the islands
to punish this wicked cruelty to his countrymen. He
fell ill, however, and died of fever before he could
start. Thus Manila escaped the fate that must almost
surely have fallen upon the city if the Chinese chief
and his great army had reached the bay.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The foolish attack upon the Chinese took so many
Spanish soldiers from the southern islands that the
Moros now had free swing along the coasts of Mindanao
and the Visayas. Other troubles came up in
Manila, and soon evil and sorrow were as active and
as real as though the islands had never been cleansed
by book and ceremony. Not even these can stay the
results of cruelty and evil in men’s lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor Governor-General Lara, in spite of his wish to
be a good leader in the Philippines, made many enemies.
These men began to accuse him of dishonesty in
office. They charged him with disloyalty to the king,
and he was put into prison. He was also made to pay
a fine equal to $60,000, Mexican money. Afterwards
he was set free, but he never got over the effects of
his disgrace. Filled with sorrow and shame, he went
back to Spain and became a friar.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1663 Diego Salcedo became governor-general. He
was no sooner in office than the good understanding
between the Church and the State came to an end.
Salcedo treated Archbishop Problete very harshly, and
took from him many of the privileges granted him by
Lara. Great strife grew out of this, and the government
was soon in as bad order as it had ever been.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last the archbishop became ill and died. Salcedo
then behaved in a very unseemly manner. He made
a great feast, and would not allow the usual mourning
services to be held for the archbishop. This conduct
came to the ears of the authorities at home, and the
governor-general was punished as he deserved. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>was put into prison to await the sailing of the galleon
that should take him to Mexico for further punishment.
He was sent to Mexico later, but died at sea
on his way there.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this was a sad end to the new rule that was to
have done so much good in the country. No good,
however, can grow out of injustice and cruelty. These
people may have meant well, but they did not do right.
They had not set up rules of fairness and truthful
dealing in the islands, so all their cleansing with words
came to naught.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—In 1653 a new governor-general and a new
archbishop were sent out to Manila. The land was blessed
and pronounced clean of all the evil that had been done
there. There was now to be a new state of things. For some
years matters went better at Manila. There was peace between
the Church and the State. Later, however, revolt
broke out here and there in the Visayas. To quiet the
natives they were promised forgiveness if they would come in
and lay down their weapons. The Spanish general who made
this promise broke his word. Those who came and surrendered
were severely punished, and only a few were pardoned.
After this the government tried to make the natives work
without pay, cutting timber for the arsenal. This made
trouble, and there was a rebellion which came near to being
general, but which was finally put down. A threatened invasion
by Koxinga, a Chinese chief from Formosa, led to
a general slaughter by the Spanish of the Chinese in Manila.
Only 5,000 Chinese were left alive in the islands. Governor-General
Lara made enemies who accused him of dishonesty.
He was put in prison and fined. He was set free later, but felt
the disgrace so keenly that he went back to Spain and took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>holy orders. He was succeeded by Diego Salcedo, who soon
quarreled with the archbishop. When the latter died, Salcedo
behaved in a way so unseemly that he was sent out of the
country in disgrace. He died at sea, on his way to Mexico.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The Spanish galleons which used to sail the
Pacific Ocean between Manila and Mexico
have been the subject of many a romance.
The world never tires of reading the stories
written about them. They seem to belong to the age
of romance and poetry. The galleons come, however,
pretty close to modern times. The last one left Manila
for Mexico in 1811, and the last one for Manila sailed
from Acapulco in 1815.</p>

<p class='c007'>These ships were in shape something like a half-moon.
They were very high at bow and stern, short
from fore to aft, and very wide. They were of about
1,500 tons burden, with light draught. They usually
had four decks, and always carried big guns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The galleons were the Spanish mail ships, and the
only carriers for trade between the islands and Mexico.
This trade with Mexico was the colony’s only
source of income. The local government had no
money of its own. It could not act independently;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>all that it brought in tribute and taxes to the royal
treasury belonged to the Crown, to be disposed of at
the king’s will.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only were the islands governed through Mexico,
but all their trade was with that country. So severe
were the laws that restricted their trade, that the people
were not allowed to go even to China and Japan
to buy goods. They might buy only such goods as
Chinese and Japanese traders brought to Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once a year, usually in July, a galleon left Manila
laden with goods from the islands. These were sold
in Mexico, and the money which they brought, or
an equal value in Mexican goods, was sent back on
the return galleon. We have seen how great were the
risks which these ships ran in making their voyages.
The enemies of Spain often captured them, while some
were lost at sea and never again heard from. It was
not all romance, the life of those who sailed and
manned the galleons. Often there was greed and
cruelty to contend with, rather than poetry and story
to be lived. Always there was danger, and it was not
the spirit of adventure, but the desire for gain that
sent these men to sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The many risks which the galleons ran made shipping
ventures uncertain. Nor was this the greatest ill
which the Manila merchants had to bear. The merchants
of Spain were always jealous of them, for they
were afraid that the island trade with China and with
Mexico would hurt their own business. So they were
always clamoring for laws that should keep Manila
merchants from dealing with those countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the beginning of the eighteenth century very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>harsh laws had been made governing all shipments.
Goods might be shipped only in bales of a certain size
and weight, and only a limited number of bales might
be sent by each galleon. Nor did the restrictions end
here. There were some goods in which Manila merchants
might not deal at all. They could ship no
woven stuffs save the finest
linen. If the goods sent to
Mexico by the Philippine Government brought more
than a certain amount in Mexico, the full sum could
not be sent back in money. The islands must take
the surplus in Mexican goods.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE ARRIVAL OF A SPANISH GALLEON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>So business suffered, and each year the country grew
poorer. At the same time the men who ruled the
country grew very rich. One acting governor-general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>in less than two years of service, got together a fortune
of $250,000. There were other officials, as well,
who managed to take home with them to Spain sums
nearly as large.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this, of course, worked hardship in the islands.
Money was very scarce. Merchants became bankrupt
and had to go out of business. Often the government
itself had no money with which to pay for public
work. The army, too, suffered. The soldiers had no
barracks, but lived as they could, and wherever they
found shelter. Often there were long periods when no
rations were issued to them, and they begged their food
from house to house. When their demands were not
granted, they would take by force what they wished,
and this led to great evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large army was needed to control the people and
to enforce payment of tribute. This tribute was collected
from the natives for the support of the government.
Those who had not yet been baptized were
taxed only a small sum; those who belonged to the
Church paid more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few, however, paid in money. Nearly all paid in
kind—in goods which they made, or produce which
they raised from the land. All tribute in goods was
kept in the royal storehouses until the galleon was
about to sail. Then the goods were sent to Mexico,
to be sold. Sometimes, however, some of these goods
were traded for merchandise brought to the islands by
Chinese dealers.</p>

<p class='c007'>A certain per cent. of the price which the shipments
brought in Mexico was sent back to Manila to pay
government expenses. Usually, however, this fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>percentage was not sufficient to meet these expenses.
It was needful, then, to increase it by a further sum
from the royal treasury. This additional sum was
called the “Real Situado” (rā´äl sē tö´ä dō).</p>

<p class='c007'>One galleon a year was not enough to meet the
needs of merchants who wished to ship goods to
Mexico. In 1724, therefore, a royal decree was made
public that thereafter two galleons of 500 tons each
would be sent. This decree, however, limited the
number of merchants who might ship goods, and
the amount which each might send. It also fixed the
amount in cash that might be taken in payment. All
values over this amount must be taken in Mexican
goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few years later this decree was revoked. Only
one galleon a year was to be sent, and new and more
severe restrictions were put upon all shipments. It
became more and more difficult, as time went on, for
the merchants of Manila to carry on trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the eighteenth century no foreign merchants
were allowed to do business in Manila. Spain, in fact,
did all that she could to kill trade and industry in the
islands. At the same time she compelled those who
ruled the country to enforce payment of the last
penny’s value of tribute that could be drained from
the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The governor-general at this time (1754–1759) was
Pedro de Arandia (dā ä rän´dē ä). He was one of the
most able and enterprising officials the islands had
thus far had. He tried to make a good many reforms
in the country, and to build up its commerce. He is
said to have died of worry and regret that he could
not rule the land as he thought right, and at the same
time be at peace with those about him who were also
in authority.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Arandia showed himself to be something of a statesman.
He made reforms in the army, and tried to bring
the wild tribes to acknowledge Spain’s rights in the
islands. At the same time he did many dishonest
things. He made a great fortune for himself while
in office. Perhaps he was sorry for his dishonesty
afterwards, for when he died he left his fortune to
religious institutions. In those days men saw no wrong
or absurdity in devoting ill-gotten wealth to carrying
on good works.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Arandia who formed the first real military
body in the country. This was a regiment made up
of five companies of Filipino soldiers and four companies
of Europeans. The latter Arandia had brought
with him from Mexico. He called the whole corps
the “King’s Regiment,” and took great pride in it.
As troops came in from the provinces they were added
to the regiment, until at last it numbered about 2,000
soldiers in two battalions of ten companies each. In
October of 1754 the soldiers, for the first time in the
history of the islands, were quartered in barracks.
They were also, both officers and men, paid regularly
every two weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1755 the Chinese question came up again. This
time it was decided to send home all those Chinese
who would not be baptized. They were given a few
months to wind up their business, and a day was set
when they should leave the islands. All who accepted
baptism were allowed to remain, and a good many did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>this. Over 2,000, however, were sent out of the country
on June 30, 1755.</p>

<p class='c007'>Need now arose for shops and for small traders to
carry on business in place of these Chinese. To supply
this need a trading company of Spanish and half-Spanish
was formed in Manila. This trading company
was in existence for some years, but was never
very successful. It could not buy on as good terms
as the Chinese had been able to make, nor could it
sell to such good advantage. It received a great deal
of aid from the government, but finally made a bad
failure and went out of business.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ruling which sent the Chinese out of the islands
worked other harm to the business of the country. Not
only were there none to do the work which the Chinese
had done, but their going was a direct money loss
to the government. The Chinese had been heavily
taxed, and when they were sent away a shortage of
$30,000 in the tax receipts followed as a direct result.
This made money so scarce in Manila that a petition
was sent to Spain asking for a reduction of the royal
dues. These royal dues were the amount which the
colony had each year to raise for the king, and the
government was now scarcely able to collect it from
the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Spain was in great need of money. Wars with
other nations had almost emptied her treasury, and
the petition for reduction was refused. A decree was
passed, however, which made things a little easier for
the merchants. The islands must pay the full amount
of the royal dues, but merchants might send by the
galleon more goods and goods of a finer quality than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>before. They might also bring back more Mexican
goods. In this way they could make more money,
and thus the country was better able to raise the sums
demanded.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The only trading ships that carried shipments
of goods from Manila were the Spanish galleons. The entire
trade of the islands was with Mexico, and was restricted by
very severe laws. A galleon sailed but once a year, and the
amount of goods which could be sent by her was limited by
law. The great risks which the galleons ran made shipments
uncertain of return, and business was at a disadvantage. In
1724 a decree was made public allowing two galleons a year,
of 500 tons each, to be sent. The number of merchants who
could ship goods was now limited, and the amount that each
could send. Later this decree was revoked. Only one galleon
could be sent, and more severe restrictions were put upon
shipments. No foreign merchants were allowed to do business
in Manila. In 1754 Pedro de Arandia became governor-general.
He made many improvements in the army, and
tried to build up trade. He formed the first real military body
in the islands, and called it the “King’s Regiment.” In 1755
a law was made that all Chinese who refused baptism should
be sent out of the country on June 30. Over 2,000 were
sent away on that day. This made a dearth of traders, and
a trading company of Spanish and half-Spanish was formed.
It was never a success, however. The departure of these
Chinese cost the country a loss of $30,000 in taxes that year.
This made times so hard that the colony prayed the king for
a reduction in the royal dues. Their petition was refused,
but some of the restrictions in regard to shipments by the
galleon were made lighter. Merchants could ship more and
better goods. This made matters easier, and the country
could better meet the demands of the Crown.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span><i>Questions.</i>—What were the Spanish galleons? How often
did they sail? When did the last one leave Manila for
Mexico? Why were such severe restrictions put upon the
trade of the islands? What were some of these restrictions?

the army? Give an account of the decree expelling the
Chinese from the islands. What effect followed the departure
of the Chinese?</p>

It was while Pedro de Arandia was governor-general
that the famous overflow of Taal
volcano took place. At that time the
crater of Taal was torn open so that it
measured more than a mile and a half across, and from
this awful opening poured down a broad stream of
melted lava, killing and destroying everything that it
touched. It rushed down the side of the mountain
and fell hot and hissing into the lake. Great clouds of
steam arose from the heated waters, and such a shower
of ashes and stones fell as made the people think the
world was coming to an end.</p>

<p class='c007'>For six months terrible storms raged in that part
of Luzon. The volcano broke out on the 15th day
of May, 1754, and it was then that the boiling lava
began to flow. Huge stones shot up from the crater
and fell into the lake, or were hurled down upon
the land. Darkness reigned, and the people were
filled with terror.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>This state of things lasted until about the second
day of June. Then, suddenly, a mighty column of
smoke arose from the mountain, thick, black, and
awful. Higher and higher it mounted, until it spread
over the sky, and the sun shone through it with a
sickly yellow light.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_110.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>TAAL VOLCANO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This smoke poured out for nearly all the time until
July 10. On that day heavy showers of mud, black
as ink, began to fall. Terrible sounds were heard, as
of cannon being fired off inside the mountain. The
land trembled, and great waves from the lake dashed
against the shore. Dead fish, alligators, and snakes
were cast up on shore, and the town of Balili (bä lē´lē)
was soon a swamp of black, liquid mud.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then fire began to pour out of the crater. It lasted
until September 25, when there was another great
shower of stones. The people of Taal were driven
from their homes and fled for their lives. Then, writes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Fray Francisco Venenchillo (ven en chēl´yō), who,
through these dreadful weeks of disasters, kept a daily
journal of all that he observed, “a fearful storm of
thunder and lightning began, and never stopped until
December 4.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meanwhile the volcano was still in eruption,
and awful things kept happening. Lake Bombon rose
and swept over the town of Taal. On November 14
inky darkness settled over the country. This lasted
for two days, during which, even as far away as Manila,
candles were needed at noonday. During these two
days, fire and lava poured out steadily from the mountain.
At last, on December 2, began a two days’
hurricane. It wiped out the town of Taal, and then
all was quiet.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all, the trouble lasted for six months and seventeen
days. The towns of Taal, Sananan (sän ä´nän),
Sala (sä´lä), and Lipa (lē´pä) were wholly ruined, and
great harm was done in towns fifteen miles distant
from the volcano. It was a marvelous event, and
traces of it are still to be seen in all the country around
Lake Bombon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never since then has there been such an overflow
from Taal volcano. The ruins of the old town of
Taal may still be seen just where the Pansipit (pän sē´pit)
River enters the lake, but they are being overgrown
by grasses and flowers. In a few years they will be
quite hidden. The present town of Taal is farther up
the river. It is noted for the fine sugar produced
there. This sugar is well known, and commands a
good price in foreign markets. Excellent cotton stuffs
are also made there.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>When Governor-General Arandia had formed his
new King’s Regiment, he at once found work for it to
do. Besides the regiment he collected a body of good
native troops and began a campaign against the Igorrotes.
The Spanish had never been able to subdue
these people. In Arandia’s day they were still as wild
and savage as when the Europeans first came to the
islands. Arandia set out to conquer them or to kill
every one of them that could be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The war was carefully planned. About 1,100 soldiers
were sent against them, and these soldiers waged
a warfare as savage, as cruel, as the wild tribes themselves
could have carried on. The Igorrotes were surprised
in their villages and given no quarter. Their
towns were burned down, and women and children
were killed without mercy. Growing crops were destroyed,
and the land was laid waste wherever an Igorrote
home was found.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in spite of this cruelty the Spanish could not
conquer the people. Instead, the King’s Regiment was
driven back again and again, and whenever the Igorrotes
took a Spaniard prisoner, they avenged upon
him the wrongs of their tribe. The attempt was at
last given up. The Igorrotes could not be subdued,
nor could they be coaxed into swearing loyalty to
Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arandia then sought to bargain with them. In 1758
a decree was passed that was meant not only for them,
but for the other heathen tribes. The decree read
that those who would accept baptism need pay no
tribute or tax for the rest of their lives. The Igorrotes
were not caught by this offer. As a matter of fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>they gave themselves no trouble to pay tribute or tax,
anyway, so the offer had no attraction for them.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>IGORROTES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At this same time Arandia had still another trouble
on his hands, but one for which he was not to blame.
A few years before, in 1749, the sultan of Sulu was
deposed from his throne during a rebellion. Being in
name, at least, a vassal of Spain, he came to Manila
to ask Spanish aid in regaining his rights.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p>A STREET IN JOLÓ.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>The acting governor-general at that time was the
Bishop of Nuevo Segovia (nö ā´vō sā gō´vē ä). This
worthy gave the sultan a warm welcome and showed
him high honor. The Moro ruler was urged to accept
baptism, and at last did so, with several of his suite.
After that he and a large number of followers were
kept in great style in Manila. The sultan was known
as Ferdinand I., and great attention was paid him as
rightful ruler of the Sulu archipelago. But for some
reason nothing was done to help him recover his lost
throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, however, he was told that he was to be
taken to Sulu. In fact, with a large Spanish escort,
the party did go as far as Zamboanga. There the sultan
and his people, with a prince of Sulu who had
come to Mindanao to greet him, were thrown into
prison. To explain this, it was charged that the sultan
had written disloyal letters to friends in Sulu. In one
of these letters, it was claimed, he had said that he had
not acted of his own free will in accepting baptism.
These letters had been intercepted at Zamboanga, and
were declared to be treasonable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sultan was taken back to Manila as a prisoner,
and this act at once drove the Moros to fresh fury.
Again there was war all along the southern coast. It
was pressed with great cruelty on both sides, and many
lives were lost. The trouble lasted for some years,
but the Spanish gained neither power nor territory
by all this waste of lives and money.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Arandia came into office he wished to send
the sultan back to Sulu and restore to him his rights.
In this, however, he was opposed by the clergy. Had
he persisted in trying to do this it would have made
great strife; so he yielded. Ferdinand I. stayed on in
Luzon, but was not kept in confinement. His son, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>daughter, and several chiefs of his people were with
him in the city; but he was none the less a prisoner,
and remained such until the British took Manila in
1762. In 1763 the English commander sent him to
Sulu and reseated him on his throne. As for the
Moros of the Sulu archipelago, they never again trusted
the Spanish.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—In the year 1754 there was a terrible eruption
of Taal volcano. It began on May 15 and lasted for over
six months. During this time the mountain poured out fire
and lava. Awful showers of mud and stones fell, and there
were terrible hurricanes. The towns of Taal, Sananan, Sala,
and Lipa were wholly ruined, and great harm was done in
places fifteen miles away. During Arandia’s term of office,
war was waged against the Igorrotes, to conquer or to kill
them all. This war was carried on with great cruelty, but
the Igorrotes were not to be subdued, and it was given up.
Later they were offered freedom from taxation if they would
accept baptism, but they refused it. In 1749 the sultan of
Sulu came to Manila seeking aid to put down a rebellion
of his people. He was well received, and was persuaded to
let himself be baptized. Afterwards it was claimed that he
had written treasonable letters home, and he was kept a
prisoner in Manila. Arandia tried to have him restored to
his rights, but could not. The sultan was sent back in 1763
by the British, who then held Manila. This treatment of the
sultan greatly enraged the Moros against the Spanish.</p>

In the latter part of the year 1761 war was begun
between Spain and France on the one
hand, and England on the other. Spain and
France were first to declare this war, but
England carried on her part in it with great vigor.
The English took Havana, and an English fleet under
Admiral Cornish (k̤or´nish) was sent to the Pacific
with orders to take the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a fleet of thirteen vessels Admiral Cornish
entered Manila Bay on the evening of September 22,
1762. The ships anchored off Cavite, and next day
Cornish sent to demand the surrender of the city. This
was, of course, refused by Archbishop Rojo (rō´hō),
who was then acting governor-general of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>The archbishop’s forces at that time consisted of
a small part of the King’s Regiment, not more than
about 600 men and officers, and 80 pieces of artillery.
The English troops, who were landed under command
of General Draper (drā´per), numbered one regiment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>British infantry, two companies of artillery, 2,200
Sepoys from India, and 3,000 seamen—in all, 6,380
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, in spite of the inequality of the two
armies, the Spanish Churchman defied the second demand
to surrender. A part of the Spanish force went
bravely out to fight the landing English, but with what
success it is easy to guess. They were driven back
into the city, and the enemy landed in full force. The
British encamped around Manila, at Malate (mä lä´tā),
Santiago, and San Juan. On the 24th of September
they began to bombard the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time one of the royal galleons was expected
at Manila. This was the <i>Philipina</i>, carrying a very
rich cargo and a large sum of money for the government.
Some of the English ships went out to lie in
wait for her. They missed her; for the Spanish friars
managed to reach her first, and by their aid she gained
a place of safety. The British, however, brought in
another galleon, the <i>Trinidad</i>, from which they took
$2,500,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>A nephew of the archbishop was on board the <i>Trinidad</i>,
and was captured with the ship. When the English
learned who he was, they sent him to Manila with
an escort, and turned him over to his uncle. The
escort then started back to the ship, but was attacked
and killed by Filipinos. The natives cut off the head
of the English officer, and refused to give it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The British were greatly angered by this outrage,
and they now stormed the city in earnest. The Spanish
had by now got together a large native force, which
was sent against the enemy. They could not stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>against the British regulars, however, and were soon
beaten back. The enemy’s artillery made great
breaches in the walls, and on October 5 General
Draper and his army forced a way into the city. By
another day the following terms of surrender were
agreed upon:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_119.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>ROYAL GATE AND SALLY PORT IN THE CITY WALL, MANILA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish were to have full religious freedom;
private property was to be held safe; the Supreme
Court was to keep order, and free trade was to be
allowed. The Spanish were to pay the British an
indemnity of $4,000,000. These terms were signed,
and the British flag floated over Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The English and Sepoy troops, turned loose in
the city, did great mischief and destroyed much public
property. The archbishop then went to General
Draper and begged him to put a stop to this. The
general issued orders forbidding violence and pillage
by his soldiers. He himself shot and killed one Sepoy
whom he saw attack a Filipino.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while the British were in possession of Manila,
they were not without opposition. It was the law in
the archipelago that if at any time the country should
be without a governor-general, the Supreme Court
should govern. This law one of the justices of the
court now tried to put in force. Simon de Anda y
Salazar (sē´mōn dā än´dä ē säl ä thär´), the justice in
question, pretended to think that the Spanish could
have held Manila but for the weakness of the archbishop.
Refusing to listen to reason, he gathered a
band of Filipinos whom he promised to lead against
the English. With a few of them he fled in a prahu
to Bulacan the night before the city surrendered. He
took with him some of the stamped paper of the government.
This would, he knew, be a help to him in a
plan which he meant to carry out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, ignoring the fact that Archbishop Rojo was
the acting governor-general, Simon de Anda began an
absurd fight against the English. He claimed the
right, as a justice of the Supreme Court, to act as
governor-general. On the stamped paper he wrote a
proclamation ordering the British to leave Manila.
He sent this proclamation to General Draper, who
ignored it and declared Anda a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this Anda raised a small army, and fought several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>battles with the British. They only served to keep
the country stirred up, so that neither the Spanish
nor the British could go about their affairs in peace.
General Draper, meanwhile, was busy restoring the
sultan of Sulu to his throne. Anda had become a
hindrance to peace, while at the same time he had no
power to carry on effective warfare. Seeing this, the
Chinese of Pampanga made a plot to kill him.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Simon de Anda was told of this plot, and his rage
was great. He collected all his Filipinos and marched
against the Chinese. He had real war at last, and the
Spanish accounts say that 8,000 Chinese were slain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime the war in Europe was over. By
the Peace of Paris, made February 10, 1763, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>settled that Manila should be restored to Spain. The
British commander made ready to turn over the city
to the Spanish and go home, but at once a new difficulty
arose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Simon de Anda was in command of whatever Spanish
army there was in the islands at this time. Therefore,
when a notice was sent to the archbishop for
the “Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish forces,” the
archbishop sent it on to Anda. This notice was to
the effect that Anda should take over the city from
the English; but he refused to receive the notice. He
declared that he should have been addressed as “Captain-General,”
and would recognize no other style of
address. On this foolish plea he kept up war with the
English until January, 1764, in spite of the peace between
his country and England. All that the British
wished was that Anda should let them hand the city over
to him and depart. This, however, he would not do.</p>

<p class='c007'>On January 30, 1764, Archbishop Rojo died. There
was still, however, no one to whom to give up Manila,
for several men at once claimed the right to act as
governor-general.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last the Spanish Government sent out from Mexico
a new governor-general. As soon as he reached
Manila he sent word to the British commander that he
was ready to take over the city, and he arranged that
Simon de Anda should be the one actually to receive
the city back. It was turned over to Anda for the
governor-general, and the English left the country.
Only $1,000,000 was paid of the $4,000,000 war indemnity
agreed upon, but the English received a bill
upon the Madrid treasury for the remainder of that sum.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span><i>Summary.</i>—In the latter part of 1761 war began between
France and Spain on the one hand, and England on the other.
In September, 1762, a British fleet came to Manila and took that
city. Archbishop Rojo, who was acting governor-general, surrendered
the city. Simon de Anda, a justice of the Supreme
Court, opposed the surrender of Manila. He fled to Bulacan,
gathered a native army, and issued a proclamation ordering the
British to leave the islands. This proclamation was not heeded.
Several ineffective battles were fought, and strife continued between
the English and Anda’s forces. The Chinese made a plot
to kill Anda, and he fought them with his army. When peace
was declared in Europe, it was decided that Manila should be
given back to Spain. Simon de Anda, as commander of the
Spanish army in the Philippines, should have received the
city from the English. He claimed not to have been properly
addressed, and refused to accept the notice telling him
of the treaty of peace. He kept up the war against the British
until January, 1764. The archbishop died on January 30,
1764. Several men now claimed the right to act as governor-general.
At last the home government sent out a new governor-general,
who took over the city, and the English left the
islands.</p>

While the British were in Manila, and for
several years after they left the country,
the islands were very unquiet. There were
many small uprisings among the people, who
hoped, in this time of unrest, to gain some of the
rights which they felt were theirs.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these uprisings was led by a native named
Silan (sē´län). This man was not quite sane, and made
many pretensions, such as that he was the earthly
representative of divine power. Many of Simon de
Anda’s followers deserted him to join Silan’s army,
and for a time Silan was very successful against the
Spanish. He turned the vicar-general of Ilocos Sur
out of his house, and made the Augustine friars pay
tribute to support the rebel forces. His brain was
weak, however, and success seemed wholly to destroy
his reason. He came to think that he was
more than human, and then, of course, he began to
make mistakes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>At last Silan joined with the British against his own
country. This opened the eyes of the Filipinos to his
real nature. They saw that he was ready to betray
them instead of leading them against their enemies,
and at once they turned from him. In May, 1763,
he was killed by a half-caste named Vicos (vē´kōs),
and the rebellion which he had led died out.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were other revolts in Luzon, however. Everywhere
the people were ready, on any pretext, to take
up arms against authority. They refused to pay tribute,
and resented all demands of Spain upon them.
Small riots kept breaking out in the provinces, and the
loyal troops were constantly marching about the island
in pursuit of rebels. In all this petty warfare the
Spanish lost 70 Europeans and 140 native soldiers, and
fully 10,000 natives were slain. By the year 1765, however,
the Spanish had the country again under control,
and some degree of peace settled over the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was still political strife in Manila, even though
the people were no longer in revolt. This strife at
last became very serious. A bitter quarrel also existed
between the Augustine friars on the one hand, and the
members of the Society of Jesus on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Augustines were the first order of friars to send
priests to the islands. From earliest times the Augustine
friars had been concerned in the welfare of the
people. Like all other leaders in the islands, they
made many mistakes, but they also did many wise
and good things. An Augustine friar had first (in
1595) taught the Filipinos the art of weaving, and as
early as 1610 the Archbishop of Manila, an Augustine
friar, had founded the College of Santo Tomas.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>The Jesuits also had a college in Manila, San José
College, founded by them in 1601. This Society had
among its members many fine scholars. It had done
much for education in the islands, and the Jesuit
priests were nearly all men learned in law and matters
of government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each party to this quarrel between the orders accused
the other of cruelty to the natives. Each declared
that the other was hindering the government in
its rule, instead of helping to keep the peace. At last
the trouble became so serious that, in 1768, the Jesuits
left the archipelago. It was thought best for the peace
of the country that they should go, and they remained
away for ninety-one years. In 1859 the Society again
came to the islands and took up its work among the
people.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time the Jesuits left, Governor-General José
Raon (hō sā´ rä ōn´) was accused by the other Orders of
favoring this Society. He was charged with telling the
Jesuits state secrets, and on this charge was disgraced
and sent home. Soon afterwards Simon de Anda,
who was in Spain during this time, was made governor-general,
and came back to Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anda took up the reins of government, confident
that he was just the man to rule these islands. In
this, however, he was mistaken. He was headstrong
and imprudent. He was unwilling to forgive his enemies
or to be advised by his friends. Indeed, his
hasty temper and his lack of good sense before long
turned his friends from him. He quarreled with the
officers of the State, of the army, and of the Church,
and his rule was a stormy one. He soon wore himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>out, and in 1776 he died in the hospital of San Juan
de Dios, at Cavite.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>At this time new ideas of human rights and liberties
were stirring the whole world. In Europe people were
growing bolder and freer in their protests against
tyranny. In America the colonies had begun the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>eight years’ war that was to free them from England’s
unjust rule. In Mexico was growing the discontent
that only ended when Mexico had thrown off the yoke
of Spain. Everywhere the people were demanding
freedom; but in the Philippine Islands a plan was
forming to take from the natives still more of the
little liberty they had.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the year 1778 Don José Basco y Vargas (hō sā´
bäs´ cō ē vär´ gäs) became governor-general of the archipelago.
He found business at a low ebb, and the country
very poor. The treasury was nearly empty; the
people had no money, and the industries of the country
were almost at a standstill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vargas was in some ways a wise man. He saw that
farming, and not trade, was the work that alone could
bring prosperity to these islands. Farming, however,
was neglected. The country could be very rich if the
people would but give their attention to raising the
crops that grow so readily here. Rice, cocoanuts,
hemp, coffee, tea, sugar—all of which are things that
the whole world uses—could be grown here, so that
the islands under cultivation would rank with the rich
countries of the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this Vargas understood. He saw that great sums
of money could be made off the land, and he resolved
that it should be done. But, like others who had been
in office before him, his thought was for Spain, instead
of for the people. He cared nothing that the Filipinos,
too, should share in whatever good might come to the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>There can, however, be no real prosperity in a country
unless it is shared by all the people in it. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>class cannot always go on getting good things while
another goes without. This fact Vargas forgot. His
plan for improving things concerned itself only with
the good that should result to the royal treasury. He
gave no thought to the effect the plan might have on
the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tobacco had been grown in the Visayas from the
beginning of Spanish rule. The Spaniards brought
the seed with them from Mexico, and the plant was
taken into China from these islands. Up to the time
when Vargas came, the crop had never been a large one
here, but under the system which he started it soon
became the most important industry in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1781 the growing and selling of tobacco on the
island of Luzon was made a government monopoly.
This meant that no man might raise or sell a single
leaf of tobacco without first having permission from
the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before this, any man who wished to do so might
raise as much tobacco as he could, and might sell it
when and as he pleased. All this was now changed.
The farmers on Luzon who had good tobacco land
were compelled to raise this crop, or else forfeit the
use of their land and its products for a term of years.
If a man refused to plant tobacco, his land was taken
from him for three years, and another man might
cultivate it. A law was also passed compelling the
tobacco planters and laborers to work on the crop
whenever labor was needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The way in which the plan worked was very simple.
The government made a contract with a planter for his
crop. The price to be paid was based upon an estimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of what the land was likely to yield. If at harvest
time the crop was less than this estimate, the
planter had to pay a heavy fine. If, on the other hand,
it was larger than had been estimated, he could not
keep a single leaf for his own use; it must all be
turned over to the officials, and what the government
did not use was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was very hard, and the power given to tobacco
inspectors made it harder still. These officers had
authority to look wherever they saw fit for hidden
tobacco. They might search the house of a tobacco
grower, or even the persons of himself and his family,
if they suspected him of hiding a few leaves for his
own use. This worked much evil, and more than one
inspector, in the early days of the system, was killed
by an angry planter whose home and family he thus
molested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new system of tobacco-growing worked well for
the authorities. Never before had the treasury been
so well filled. The royal dues were promptly paid,
and for the first time in the history of Spain’s rule
here, the colony seemed likely to become profitable
to the Crown. The home government was delighted,
and Vargas was much praised. The tobacco monopoly,
however, laid a heavy hand upon the most useful
class of Spain’s Filipino subjects. It oppressed
the farmers and the land-owners. These are the people,
in every country, who are most deeply interested
in good government. They are the mainstay of national
order and prosperity. When this class in any
land suffers, no other can long remain prosperous.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was late in the day, moreover, for such a system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to be inaugurated. It belonged to a less enlightened
age in the history of mankind, and in the end it cost
Spain more than it ever profited her. The Filipino
people were coming out of the darkness in which they
had so long been kept. They were learning that mere
blind revolt would help them none, and this knowledge
was in itself of great worth. It is not in human nature
to bear patiently such wrongs as they now suffered,
and the wrath of the people smoldered, ready to
break out at any moment. Whenever it did blaze up,
there was trouble for Spaniards and Filipinos alike.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The presence of the British in the islands was
a signal for further revolts of the people. There were uprisings
all over the island of Luzon after the British left, and
the Spanish forces were kept busy marching after rebels. It
is estimated that some 10,000 natives lost their lives in these
uprisings. A bitter quarrel between the Augustine friars and
the Jesuits resulted in the Jesuits leaving the country in 1768.
Governor-General Raon fell into disgrace at about the same
time, and was removed from office. He was succeeded by
Simon de Anda, whose rule was not successful. In 1778 Don
José Basco y Vargas became governor-general. He made the
growing of tobacco in Luzon a government monopoly. This
system brought money into the royal treasury, but worked
great hardship for the farmers.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—Give an account of Silan’s revolt. What was
the cause of the trouble between the Augustine friars and the
Jesuits? When did the Jesuits leave the country? Who
succeeded José Raon as governor-general? What system
of tobacco culture did he introduce? How did this system
affect the country?</p>

In the year 1800, Spain, while still a proud
nation, was no longer a powerful one. In
earlier centuries she had led the world in
commerce, in the arts, and in science. She
had known wise and far-sighted rulers, and her scholars
had been among the greatest in the world. Europe,
when any new enterprise was talked of, waited for
Spain to take the lead in action regarding it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, little by little, Spain fell behind other countries
in the march of progress. Other nations improved
their navies and their merchant ships, while Spain still
clung to the old galleons of hundreds of years ago.
She made no progress in her merchant service, nor
much in her naval strength. Other nations were seeking
trade and new chances for prosperity; Spain still
kept her markets closed to the outside world. In the
year 1800 she even passed a law forbidding foreigners
to live in the Philippine Islands. Such a law could
not be fully enforced at that stage of the world’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>progress, but Spain did succeed in keeping the port of
Manila closed to outside commerce.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her colonies might not even trade freely with one
another. Mexico might not send to the Philippines
for goods, lest the Mexicans should buy less from
Spain. Merchants in the Peninsula looked with great
jealousy upon the growing trade between the Philippines
and America. Foreign merchants could not do
business in Manila, and every effort was made to limit
the nature of the trade in that port. Cuba, Porto
Rico, and other Spanish colonies suffered, as well,
from the harsh restrictions which the mother country
put upon their trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government of the Philippine Islands had grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to be of the very worst sort. Many of the high officials
were mere adventurers from Spain. They had no
higher idea of right than their own wills; they neither
loved nor understood the people, and they could not
command the good will or the respect of the Filipinos.
Many of the latter were superior in character
and in education to the men who ruled the country,
and the people were held in check by fear rather than
by loyalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government system of tobacco-growing early
became a great source of trouble. Constant watching,
heavy fines, imprisonment, even whipping, came
to be necessary in order to hold the people to work
on the tobacco crop, and much evil and injustice
were done against the people by the officials who enforced
these measures.</p>

<p class='c007'>As was to be expected, the people often rebelled.
Serious riots happened among the tobacco growers in
northern Luzon in 1807, and again in 1814. In these
there was great loss of life among both Spanish and
Filipinos. Moreover, to add to the evil of forcing the
people to grow tobacco, the government was very slow
in paying the planters. Year after year these men
were compelled either to raise tobacco or to give up
their land, while they could get scarcely any return for
their work. When at last the government made payment,
it paid in treasury notes. These the people
were forced by necessity to sell for almost nothing, to
speculators who went about buying them up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The islands suffered much from all these bad conditions,
and the people became impatient and rebellious
over the injustice heaped upon them. The American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Revolution had had a marked effect upon all
Europe. It had awakened ideas of liberty in the common
people everywhere, and had set the whole world
thinking about the rights of man. The freedom of
this one country helped to insure the liberties of all
other lands. Even in the far-off Philippines the echo
was heard of the demand for that justice and decent
treatment which is every man’s right.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England, in France, and in Germany, men were
asking for a voice in their own government, and their
demand was winning a hearing. Besides this, the
people of Mexico had now begun the struggle which
ended at last in their throwing off Spain’s yoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the year 1810 it was plain that it would no longer
be possible to carry on the colony’s trade by means of
the galleons to Mexico. The Spanish Cortes (cor´tās),
therefore, passed a decree discontinuing these ships,
and Manila merchants were given permission to fit out
private ships, under the Spanish flag, for trade with
America. The last state galleon left Manila for Acapulco
in 1811. That same year saw the start of the
first newspaper in the Philippines, and the beginning
of an effort by the young men of Manila to bring
about a better understanding between the colony
and the mother country.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time the cause of political liberty began
to win a hearing in Spain. The Liberal Party was in
power there, and a strong feeling for popular government
was winning its way in the country. In 1809
the Supreme Council in Spain convened the famous
Cortes de Cadiz, in which were assembled delegates
from all Spain’s colonies—Cuba, Venezuela, the Philippines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>etc. The Cortes some time later passed what
is known in history as the Act of Constitution of
1812. It gave to each of the colonies the right to
send one or more representatives to the Cortes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Filipino delegate who signed this Act of Constitution
was Ventura de Los Reyes (ven tö´rä dā los
rī’es). The Act was sworn to by the proper officials in
Manila in 1813, but soon afterwards was suspended.
It came into force again, however, a few years later,
and in 1820 the Cortes again admitted representatives
from the Philippines. There were seventeen of these
representatives, and they took part in the parliamentary
debates of 1822–1823.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short time afterwards the Constitution was again
suspended by act of Ferdinand VII. A little later
King Ferdinand died, and again two Filipino deputies
sat in the Cortes. Filipino members also sat in the
Cortes during the reign of Isabella II., but upon the
opening of Parliament in 1837 it was voted to exclude
them. Thus the dream of the Filipinos, of representation
in the government, came to naught.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this gave the people a taste of political freedom.
The men who represented the islands in the Spanish
Cortes came back to Manila full of the idea of equal
rights for all. They preached this doctrine to the
people, and their words found ready hearers. Soon,
on Luzon, a group of young Filipinos and Mestizos
gathered. Their aim was to bring about real reforms
in the government, and to secure greater peace, prosperity,
and liberty to the people. The discontent of
the Filipinos began to be of a more intelligent sort,
and to have a definite purpose. The people were coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>to a clearer idea of what they wanted, and of the
nature of the reforms needed in the country.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>At this time, too, foreigners began to do business in
Manila. England, by force of arms, had gained the
right to trade with this port, and “the shut door”
was no longer possible. Mexico had obtained her freedom
from Spain, and the islands were now governed
direct from the Peninsula. The independence of Mexico
had a marked influence on the Filipinos in Luzon.
They began to feel that they too might strike for
their rights. They had no idea of winning independence,
but they felt that they must have greater liberty.
To meet this growing discontent more troops were asked
for, and were sent from Spain. The King’s Regiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>was reorganized from these, and a force of 10,000 men
was kept in and about Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Visayas matters were different. The people
there were farther from the capital. They knew little
or nothing of the changes and the differences brought
about by the Constitution of 1812. They had no idea
of the meaning of the word “equality” as between
themselves and their rulers. Most of them had never
heard of the Constitution of 1812. They did not
dream that political equality had ever been thought of
for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The colony was at this time troubled outwardly as
well as within. Spain and England were at war, and
the English were a source of danger and anxiety to the
archipelago. Several expeditions had to be raised to
fight off the British from various places on the islands,
where they had set up headquarters. The Moros and
the wild tribes of Mindanao were also giving trouble.
They even came as far north as Manila, and carried off
men and women into captivity in the south.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, during all these troubled years, a number
of useful works were undertaken and carried out by
the government. In 1817 a royal decree was issued
commanding that schools for Filipino boys and girls
should be opened in all the convents. In 1820 the
duties were taken off, for ten years, from the natural
and manufactured products of the islands sent to
Spain, and an effort was made to revive the dying
commerce of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>In this same year there was a great cholera epidemic
in Manila. Many natives, some 30,000, the accounts
say, died of it; but only one foreigner, an Englishman.
The people got the idea that the foreigners had caused
this epidemic by poisoning the water of the wells.
They rose against the foreign residents, and killed all
the English and French before the authorities could
control them. There was a feeling among the Spanish
in Manila that Governor-General Folgueras (fol gö ër´äs)
had not been as prompt as he might have been
in quelling this uprising. It was openly stated that
he had made no effort to subdue the mob until the
English and the French residents were killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>To defend himself against this accusation the governor-general
made certain criticisms of the Spanish-American
forces in the islands. He charged them with
disloyalty, recommending that they be withdrawn, and
replaced by a larger force to be sent from Spain. He
represented to the home government that this was
necessary, because the Spanish-American troops could
not be depended upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1822 a new governor-general, Señor Juan Antonio
Martinez (än tō´nē ō mär tē´neth), was sent out. With
him came many officers and soldiers from the Peninsula.
Following the advice of Folgueras, Martinez
sent a number of persons to Spain, on the pretext that
they had conspired against the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this provoked a revolt of a part of the King’s
Regiment, led by Captain Novales (nō väl´ēs), a Spanish-American.
A fierce battle was fought in the streets
of Manila on the night of June 1, 1823, and Folgueras
was slain. However, order was finally restored in the
regiment. The leaders of the revolt were executed,
and, as usual, the authorities seemed to think that the
matter needed no further attention.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span><i>Summary.</i>—At the beginning of the nineteenth century
Spain was no longer a great world power. The government
of the Philippines was full of evil, and the people had but
little justice. The tobacco monopoly had become a source
of much trouble, and the people were often in rebellion
because of it. Ideas of liberty were growing among other
nations, and the Filipinos, too, were becoming restless under
oppression. In 1811 the last state galleon for Acapulco left
Manila. The first newspaper in the Philippines was started
in 1811. In 1812 the Spanish Cortes passed the Constitution
of 1812, giving Spanish colonies representation in the
Cortes. The Constitution was sworn to in Manila in 1813.
It was afterwards suspended, but came again into force a few
years later, and in 1820 the Cortes again admitted Filipino
representatives. In 1837, however, these islands were finally
denied representation. The enemies of Spain gave the islands
much trouble during these early years of the century, and the
Moros and wild tribes of Mindanao were also in arms. In
1817 schools for Filipino boys and girls were ordered to be
opened in all the convents. In 1820 duties were taken off,
for ten years, from natural and manufactured products of the
islands sent to Spain. In that year a great cholera epidemic
raged in Manila. In 1823 occurred the revolt of a part of the

Don Juan Antonio Martinez was
governor-general of the Philippines from
1822 to 1825. During his term of office he
had much to contend with, both from the
foes of the people and from the foes of Spain. It was
during his rule that the Constitution of 1812 was done
away with. The revolt headed by Captain Novales
was no sooner quelled than danger again threatened
from the pirates of Sulu. These came against Manila,
and so daring had they grown that they even captured
and carried away the Padre-Provincial of the Recoletos
and a number of other members of that order of friars.
The captives were taken to Joló, where they were held
in ransom for the sum of $10,000. This money was
raised in Manila, and the friars were released.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this outrage, Martinez sent Captain Alonzo
Morgado (ä lon´thō mor gä´dō), with the sea forces of
the Philippines, to carry on warfare against the southern
pirates. Morgado succeeded in driving them back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>from Manila, and really punished them very severely.
It was not, however, until the year 1862, when the
Spanish brought steam gunboats into use against them,
that these pirates ceased to be a menace to the people
of Luzon and the Visayas.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Still the desire for greater political freedom grew
among the young Filipino men. New teachers arose
among them from time to time, and the spirit of discontent
spread farther and farther. In the year 1828
another revolt took place. It was headed by two
brothers, Spanish-Americans, both officers in the Spanish
force in the Philippines.</p>

<p class='c007'>This revolt was put down, as all others had been;
but it now became clear that, if peace was to be kept,
the Spanish-American soldiers must go. Most of them
had come from Mexico, which country was now independent
of Spain, and they held ideas of liberty that
were dangerous to Spanish rule in the Philippines.
A large body of troops was now brought from Spain,
and Spanish soldiers always after, while Spain ruled,
made up the foreign force in the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this same year, 1828, a royal order was issued
commanding the cultivation and protection of cotton
in the islands. The seeds of this plant had years before
been brought over from Mexico, and the friars had
tried to persuade the people to grow cotton; but they
had not been very successful. The people did not
yet know how useful cotton could be to them, or how
great an industry cotton-growing in the islands might
become. Now, however, the matter was given careful
attention. Machinery was brought over for making
thread and cloth from the cotton fiber, and every effort
was made to protect and encourage the new venture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don Mariano Ricafort (mä rē ä´nō rē´kä fort), the
governor-general at that time, made a law forbidding
foreigners to go into the provinces to buy goods or
land. As early as 1809 an English firm had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>allowed to do business in Manila, and a number of
foreigners were at this time in the city. The government
tried to keep them as much as possible within
the city, and to prevent them from mingling with
the people in the provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ricafort also tried to make the Filipinos understand
that the Spanish were their friends, and that the government
made laws for their help and protection. But
the people had become very distrustful. Even the
Church seemed no longer able to reassure them, or to
keep peace as it had done in the past. There were
small revolts, here and there in the islands, which the
government was forced to put down. A rebellion in
Bohol was only quelled after serious trouble, and at
last more troops were sent out from Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had become necessary for Spain to yield to the
demands of other countries, and open the port of
Manila to foreign vessels. These could now enter the
harbor, but they were compelled to pay double the
regular port duties. It was growing harder and harder,
in fact, for Spain to rule the islands in the old despotic
fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, in the mother country itself a party had
risen that was honestly anxious to give the archipelago
a good government. The leaders of this party
listened gladly to the reports of educated Filipinos,
and tried to learn the true state of affairs. These
leaders, however, were almost powerless to bring about
reforms, because of dissensions arising among the Filipinos
themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few of the natives could read or speak the Spanish
language. This fact alone made it hard to help them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>for still fewer Spanish ever took the trouble to learn
the native tongues. The people, therefore, were for
the most part ignorant even of those laws which gave
them rights and privileges. There were always those
in power whose interests were best served by this ignorance,
and
they took no
pains to teach
the people what
the laws were.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The country
was now sunk in
deep poverty,
and the condition
of the Filipinos
was sad indeed.
In 1836 the greed
and bad government
of Queen
Christina (kristē´na)
of Spain
had emptied the
royal treasury,
and she greatly
needed money. She tried to have her officers wring
more from the Philippines and her other colonies, but
this they could not do. The colonies, richly as nature
had gifted them, were almost drained of their wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The queen, therefore, agreed with Louis Philippe
(lö´ē fil ēp´) of France to hand over Cuba to France for
the sum of 30,000,000 reals. In the agreement to this
effect there was also a clause offering to sell Porto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Rico and the Philippine Islands to France for 10,000,000
reals more. If this agreement had gone through,
it might have made a great change in the history of
these islands; but it came to naught.</p>

<p class='c007'>The queen sent her minister, Comparvano (kom pärvä´nō),
to France, to confer with the French king and
his advisers, and there the Spaniard learned for the
first time of the clause about the Philippine Islands.
The French king wanted to bargain over this clause.
He said that in view of all the trouble in the archipelago,
and for various other reasons, the price named
was too high. In fact, he refused to pay more than
7,000,000 reals, and declared that 10,000,000 reals was
an outrageous price. Rather than pay it he would put
the contract in the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish minister asked to see the contract.
After looking at it, he said quietly, “Your Majesty is
right; it is outrageous.” And taking the king at his
word, he laid the paper on the fire. He meant that
the price was outrageously small—not large, as the
king had declared. He did a daring thing, but his
courage saved Spain from the disgrace of such a poor
bargain as the queen would have made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following year trouble broke out anew in the
Philippines. For the first time in the history of the
Church in the islands the people demanded that the
Spanish friars should be replaced by native priests.
They were loyal to the Church; but they were determined
to have men of their own blood to minister its
offices to them. This trouble had been growing for
years, and now that it was given open expression it
became serious indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>In 1841 a very grave insurrection broke out in Tayabas
(tē ä´bäs). It was headed by a native named Apolinario
de la Cruz (ä pöl ē när´ē ō dā lä kröth), who
styled himself “king of the Tagals.” He claimed
supernatural powers, and by false representations succeeded
in raising a following of some 3,000 Filipinos.
With these he went to war against the friars. He murdered
the alcalde of Tayabas Province, and made the
people believe that when they attacked the Spanish,
the earth would open and swallow up the foe.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Spaniards could muster but about 400 soldiers,
and as many more coast guards and irregular forces.
They marched out against Apolinario and his followers,
however, and defeated them, although there was great
loss of life on both sides. In Manila at this time was
a regiment of Tagal soldiers from Tayabas. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>soldiers mutinied, and would have joined Apolinario,
but were shot down by the Spanish troops before they
could leave the garrison.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apolinario himself was of unsound mind, and when
his followers began to see this, they fell away from him.
If the revolted Tagal regiment had succeeded in joining
him, his defeat might have been delayed; but in the
end he must have been overcome. In all such encounters
with the Filipinos, the Spaniards had the
advantage of better organization. The troops were
well drilled and trained to obey, and their leaders were
skilled in warfare. With no army organization and no
outside aid the Filipino people were helpless to maintain
their rights. Nevertheless, it is not in the nature
of brave men to submit tamely to injustice or oppression,
and it is no matter for surprise that though each
new revolt was promptly put down, the spirit of liberty
constantly urged the people on to new attempts to
gain some measure of freedom. From now on, these
attempts became more frequent and more desperate.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—Trouble continued to increase in the islands.
There was great danger from the southern pirates, and it had
become clear that Spanish-American soldiers could no longer
be used in the army. These soldiers sided with the people
against the government. Large bodies of troops were brought
from Spain, and the army was put upon a new footing. In
1828 a royal order was issued, commanding the growing and
protection of cotton. Foreigners were forbidden to go into
the provinces to buy land or to trade with the people. The
government now tried to make the people understand that
it was their friend, but the Filipinos had grown very distrustful.
In 1836 Queen Christina offered to sell the Philippine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Islands to France; but her ambassador, Comparvano,
whom she sent to arrange the matter, burned the contract
when he learned its contents. In 1837 the Filipinos demanded
that native priests should replace the Spanish friars.
In 1841 an insurrection headed by Apolinario de la Cruz, who
called himself “king of the Tagals,” broke out. This was
put down with great loss of life on both sides.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—Why were Spanish-American soldiers no longer
useful in the army in the Philippines? Whom did the southern
pirates capture and carry away from Manila? In what year
was the growing of cotton commanded? To whom did Queen
Christina offer to sell the islands? Who was the “king of
the Tagals”? Give an account of the revolt which he
headed.</p>

The situation in the archipelago was now very
grave indeed, and the authorities in Manila
began to see that something must be done
to meet the ever-growing discontent of the
people. A little more liberty given at this time might
have changed that discontent to gratitude. If the
people could have believed that the Spaniards desired
their good, they might have worked with the Europeans
for the benefit of the whole country.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was lack of trust and understanding on
both sides, and because of this still harsher laws were
made by the Spanish in their efforts to put down rebellion.
One of these laws provided for a rigid examination
of all books printed in the native tongues.
Such books as did not please the authorities were condemned
and burned. With regard to all books printed
in the Tagal language, this censorship was kept up
until the end of Spanish rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>Efforts were also made to keep the islands from closer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>communication with the outside world. In 1849 a royal
order again forbade foreigners to go into the provinces.
In this year the governor-general, Narciso de Claveria
(när sē´sō dā clä vā´rē ä), organized a police force for
Manila and the provinces. This force was called “The
Order of Safety for Manila.” During Claveria’s term of
office a very good reform was made in trading privileges.
The alcalde of a province had before that had the sole
right to trade with the people of his province. Under
the new law, however, any Spaniard or Filipino who
wished to do so might trade freely in the provinces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The people in the islands still had serious trouble
with the pirates from Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.
These pirates had regular fleets, and a military
force as strong as that of the Spaniards themselves,
and they had become a source of constant danger to
commerce and to the liberty of the people. So great
damage did they do, that for four years the government
was obliged to remit all tribute in the island of Negros,
one of the richest of the agricultural islands. The
ravages of these pirates had made the people so poor
that they were scarcely able to procure the necessaries
of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The danger from this source at last became so great
that trade between the islands was at a standstill. The
merchants of Manila therefore took action in self-defense,
and brought steamboats over from Europe.
These were safe, as the pirates, in their slower-going
ships, could not overtake them; but the towns lying
along the coast were still subject to raids. In 1848
Governor-General Claveria sent out an expedition to
the islands of Balanguengui, a group in the Sulu archipelago,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>where most of the pirates had their homes.
This expedition destroyed the towns of the pirates,
burned their ships, and took many captives.</p>

<p>PIRATE FLEET ATTACKING A COAST TOWN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Two or three years later Governor-General Urbiztondo
(ur bēth ton´dō) went with an expedition against
the pirates, and made a strong attack on the city of
Joló. This expedition consisted of four regiments of
artillery and a native battalion drawn from among the
people of Cebu. This island had suffered greatly
from piratic raids, and it is said that the wives of these
Cebuans declared that they would not receive their
husbands back again if they ran away from the foe.
This threat may have had some effect, for the men
fought with great bravery and gave the pirates such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>severe punishment that there were no further attacks
for several years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some years later, in 1860, when Don Fernando de
Norzagaray (nor thä gä´iī) was governor-general, eighteen
steam gunboats were sent out from Spain. With
these the Spanish forces in the archipelago were able
completely to defeat the pirates and to put an end to
the outrages that had cost the islands so much in
property and in lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1854 there was an uprising in Nueva Ecija (nö ā´vä
ā thē’hä). This uprising was headed by a Spanish-Mestizo
named Cuesta (kö ēs´tä), a young man of great
ability and promise. He had been educated in Spain,
and while there had been received at court, and had
even been shown great favor by Queen Isabella. He
had been much with members of the Liberal Party,
then gaining strength in Spain, and had caught the
new ideas of political freedom and human rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cuesta came home with an earnest desire to help his
people. He was made commandante of carabineros
in Nueva Ecija, but before he had been long in command
he incited his troops to rebellion. They attacked
the Spanish officials in the province, and made war
upon the friars. The revolt was put down, however,
and Cuesta, with several others, was executed. Still
others, who had been concerned in the uprising, were
banished from the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these things increased the anxiety of the Spanish
over the situation in the Philippines. Young Filipino
men were discouraged from going to Spain; students
in the seminarios who desired to leave these schools
and finish their education in Spain were refused permission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>to do so. The country was poor and was
overrun with bandits. Natives guilty of minor offenses
against the law were treated so severely that they took
to the jungle, becoming outlaws. Everywhere oppression
and tyranny ruled, with all the evils that these
bring in their train.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE PARIAN GATE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The tobacco monopoly was killing all other agricultural
enterprise, and the Chinese control of the trades
and small business industries was keeping the people
from earning money at these. The Filipinos had for
some years realized the evil of allowing the Chinese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>thus to monopolize the trades and minor occupations,
but they were powerless at that time to prevent such
monopoly. They could not conduct this business for
themselves; the Spanish had never been a trading
people, and the islanders had had no chance to learn
business methods from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish government in the islands had always
been military, but in 1860 a civil government was
formed for the province of Manila. Civil government
is government by laws upheld by civil, or citizen, officials,
instead of by military force. It punishes offenders
through the courts, instead of by armed power.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this same year, by command of the governor-general,
the Parian, the great building where nearly all
the Chinese in Manila were quartered, was destroyed.
This act of the government was bitterly opposed by
the Chinese and by some others; but it was carried
out, in spite of great difficulties. The only reminder
of the Parian now left is the Parian Gate, which gives
entrance to the walled city near the point where the
building once stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>These years were marked, as well, by numerous severe
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. One or two new
volcanoes were formed, and there were great disturbances
in Luzon and the islands near by. In 1863 came
the great earthquake of Manila—the severest that the
country has ever known. Thousands of people were
killed in the city and the surrounding country. The
cathedral was destroyed, and the city was reduced to
a mere mountain of ruins. Only the great wall, St.
Augustine Church, and a few other structures withstood
the shock.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>After this, trouble deepened for the country. The
treasury was drained to rebuild the city; the land was
pinched to the last possible limit to raise tribute for
the Crown; and the people were nearly desperate. The
government could not meet its payments, but insisted
upon the tobacco crop being cultivated each year; and
great quantities of tobacco had to be sold to raise
money for the needs of the moment. In 1864 lightning
set fire to the general storehouse of tobacco and
caused a loss of $2,000,000 to the colonial treasury.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1867 the “Guardia Civil” was formed, for the
purpose of capturing the bandits who overran the country.
These bandits had come to be as great a source
of danger as the pirates had been, and in 1869 the
peril of the situation was increased by a proclamation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>made by Governor-General Torre. This proclamation
offered free pardon to all bandits who should present
themselves to the government within three months.
This was a great opportunity for the ill-disposed people
of the provinces. Hundreds of them became bandits
and entered upon a three months’ term of robbery and
outrage, sure of pardon at any time they might present
themselves before the governor. It became necessary
to organize a special guard, which was called “Torre’s
Guard,” to go against this great mob of outlaws.</p>

<p>QUEEN ISABELLA II. AS A CHILD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>But in spite of murmurings, discontent, and suffering
among the people, the work of building up the
city, and of making improvements in and about Manila,
went steadily on. The palace was rebuilt, work was
begun upon the cathedral, and many public works were
undertaken. In 1865 a municipal school, in charge of
the Sisters of Charity, was founded, and a normal school
for teachers was opened in Manila under the charge of
the Jesuits, who had returned to the country in 1859,
after an absence of nearly one hundred years. The
civil government, which had recently been formed in
Manila Province, supported this school.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1868 Queen Isabella II. of Spain was deposed, and
the government that followed her was of a revolutionary
nature, founded on republican principles. While
this government prevailed, an Assembly of Filipinos
and Mestizos was formed in Manila. Its members,
who were persons born in the islands, hoped to bring
about certain reforms in the local government. They
had the power of voting reforms for the colony, subject
to the will of the home government. They outlined
many reforms which were needed in the islands,
and tried to gain for them the attention of the home
government. But the influence of the conservative
party, both at home and in the colony, prevailed. It
was not long before the monarchy was again in power,
and then this Philippine Assembly died.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Filipinos had had a taste of self-government,
and it was hard for them to go back into bondage.
It was not possible that they should again submit
patiently to the oppression which they had borne for
so many years. The spark which Spain herself had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>kindled no power on earth could extinguish, and the
little fire of liberty burned on, waiting for the moment
when it should burst into a great flame.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The situation in the Philippines was becoming
desperate. There was lack of trust between the Spanish and
the Filipinos, and this kept them from understanding or helping
one another. More and more severe measures were taken
by the rulers to keep down revolt. By the middle of the
century the ravages of pirates along the coast had nearly killed
all trade. The merchants of Manila now brought steam trading
ships from Spain, and these, being swifter than the craft of
the pirates, escaped capture; but towns along the coast were
still subject to raids. In 1848 an expedition went against the
pirates and punished them severely. Other expeditions followed
up the work of that one, and at last, in 1860, eighteen
steam gunboats were sent from Spain. With the aid of these
the Spanish forces were able to put an end to piracy in those
seas.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1854 there was a serious uprising, headed by a young
Spanish Mestizo named Cuesta. This was put down, and a
number of Filipinos who had taken part in it were executed.
This uprising greatly increased the anxiety of the government
in the islands. In 1860 a civil government was founded for
Manila Province. In this same year the Parian, the building
where the Chinese lived within the walled city, was destroyed.
In 1863 a great earthquake in Manila killed
thousands of people and reduced the city to ruins. In
1867 the Guardia Civil was formed, and efforts were made
to capture and punish the bandits who overran the country.
Much work was done during this and succeeding years
toward rebuilding the city. In 1865 a normal school for
teachers was opened in Manila. In 1868 Queen Isabella II.
was deposed, and for a time the government in Spain was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>revolutionary in character. While this government was in
power, the more enlightened Filipinos and Mestizos in Manila
tried hard to bring about reforms at home; but the new order
was short-lived, and the monarchy was soon restored to power
in Spain.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—Why were the merchants of Manila forced to
bring steamships from Spain? Give an account of the different
expeditions against the pirates. Who was Cuesta? What
was the result of the revolt which he headed? When was
the Parian destroyed? When was the great earthquake of
Manila? For what purpose was the Guardia Civil formed?

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_162.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
In 1872 took place what is now known as
the Cavite insurrection. This uprising had
in itself no real importance; it only gained
importance because of the attention which
was paid to it. The cause of the revolt was the desire
of the people for native priests. There was a party
among the native clergy whose leaders were demanding
that the friars should be forbidden to act as parish
priests, and should be made to give up certain benefits
to which they were not entitled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The native party had some right on its side in these
demands. A treaty had been made at Trent, some
years before, defining the positions and rights of the
clergy in the islands. Under this treaty the friars were
not entitled to act as parish priests. They asked this
privilege from the Pope, however, and it was granted
them. As a result the Filipino clergy could act only in
inferior positions, as assistants and lay readers. They enjoyed
but few of the rights and dignities of their calling.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>The leader of the clergy who were demanding their
rights was a priest named José Burgos (hō sā´ bur´gōs).
He was native born, and a man of great strength and
dignity of character. It is not believed that he, or the
priests who were among his followers, really incited
the revolt at Cavite. He had, however, many enemies,
and these succeeded in making him appear to be
guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>But whatever the origin of the uprising, it went
wrong through a mistake about signals. A number of
the native soldiery were concerned in the affair, and
were to have aided the plotters in Manila. It was
agreed that certain men in Manila should get everything
ready, and send up a rocket, by which signal
those at Cavite would know that the time had come
to act. It happened, however, that one night in the
latter part of January a <i>fiesta</i> was held in one of the
suburbs of Manila. Fireworks were set off, and these
the soldiers at Cavite mistook for the signal of attack.
They therefore seized the arsenal at Cavite, and attacked
the Europeans living in and about the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it was too late to undo their action, they discovered
the mistake. Their friends at Manila had no
idea what was taking place. They did not come to
the aid of the revolters at Cavite, and when they
learned the news, there was no time to gather their
forces. The loyal troops were called out, and the
trouble was put down in two days.</p>

<p class='c007'>All might even yet have gone well with the country if
this matter could have been allowed to rest right there.
The government, however, saw fit to regard this uprising
as of grave importance. All who were suspected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of a part in it were severely punished; many were shot,
and three of the native priests were garrotted. These
priests were Dr. Burgos, Dr. Mariano Gomez (mä rē ä´nō
gō´meth), and Dr. Jacinto Zamora (hä sēn´tō thä mō´rä).
As to their guilt, there will always be a doubt, and to
this day the native clergy declare that these men were
innocent of planning the revolt.</p>

<p class='c007'>These executions made the people desperate. The
secret societies which had been forming all over Luzon
had up to this time been merely local lodges of the
great society of Freemasons. Now they were turned
into political societies, with a definite aim, and that
aim was to win greater liberty for the Filipinos. These
societies afterwards played a very important part in
the history of the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the uprising at Cavite, another revolt
occurred in Zamboanga; but this was put down with
the help of the Moros. After the Cavite insurrection,
the native regiment of artillery was disbanded, and a
regiment of artillery from the Peninsula was brought
to the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of all these disturbances, considerable public
work was done during the next few years. The ports
of Legaspi, Tacloban, and Leyte were opened to foreign
commerce in 1873–1874, and in 1875 the famous
Bridge of Spain across the Pasig River, in Manila, was
built and thrown open for public use. The opening of
the Suez Canal was a helpful thing to the commerce of
the Philippines, and under wise and just government
there might have been a time of prosperity for the
country.</p>

<p>THE GROUNDS OF THE CAVITE ARSENAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>In 1877 Don Domingo Moriones y Morillo (dō min´gō mō rē ō´nās ē mō rēl´yō) became governor-general.
When he arrived in Manila, the King’s Regiment, the
mainstay of the Spanish forces in the islands, was in
revolt. This revolt had been kept a secret by the
retiring governor-general, for fear of the result if the
natives should learn the truth. The new governor-general
caused the regiment to be drawn up in line
and numbered. When this had been done, every tenth
man was told off to be shot next morning. Moriones
was afterwards persuaded to spare many of these men,
but the ringleaders were all shot; some others were
put into prison for long terms, and about fifty of them
were sent back to Spain in disgrace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The term of office upon which he entered with such
vigor was marked by a number of very good acts on
the part of the governor-general. His name should
be remembered with gratitude in Manila, for it was he
who caused the public waterworks to be built. Over
a hundred years before, a patriotic governor-general,
Don Fernando Carriedo (fer nän´dō cä rē ā´dō), had
left a fund to provide the city with a suitable water
supply. This money was to be kept at interest until
the fund grew large enough for the purpose, and it had
increased so much that work should have been begun
a good many years before. But those having the
money in charge were not willing to give it up, and it
was only after a bitter struggle that Governor-General
Moriones was able to get Carriedo’s wishes carried out.
This enterprise was a great blessing to the city of
Manila, as the value of a pure water supply cannot
be over-estimated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moriones also did what he could to get appropriations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>from the treasury to pay off the tobacco growers,
whose condition was at this time pitiful indeed. They
had not been paid for some years, while at the same
time they were not allowed to grow any other crop
by which they might maintain themselves. In 1881
this tobacco monopoly, which had worked such wrong
to the people, was ended by royal decree of King
Alfonso XII.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1880 there was a violent earthquake in Manila.
The disturbances lasted from the 14th of July to the
25th of the same month, and did a great deal of damage
in the city, causing loss of property and life.
The people were reduced to such a state of terror that
they dared not live in the better class of houses in
Manila, but took to the nipa huts in the suburbs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>These houses were less dangerous because of their
light structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>This same year cable communication was set up
between Spain and Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1881 Governor-General Primo de Rivera (prē´mō
dā rē vā´rä) came to office. One of the first things he
did was to organize an expedition against the Igorrotes
of northern Luzon; but, like all other attempts to subdue
these people, this expedition was a failure. The
Spanish soldiers who took part in it left behind them
among the Igorrotes such a record for cruelty and violence
that to this day most of these people hate the
sight of a white man.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was trouble enough for the people during
Rivera’s rule. In 1882 a cholera epidemic broke out
in Manila, and in less than three months 30,000 people
died in the city and its suburbs and throughout the
province. There were also several typhoons of unusual
violence, and a terrifying eruption of Mayon volcano,
which lasted for many months.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1883 Joaquin Jovellar y Soler (hō ä kēn´ hō vāl´här
ē sō´lėr), who had won a name for himself as the
“peacemaker” in Cuba, became governor-general of
the Philippines. He was well received by the Spanish,
and made some attempt to bring about reforms in the
country. The old-time tribute, the cause of so many
revolts among the people, was replaced by the “cedula
personal,” or paper of identity, which every inhabitant
above eighteen years of age was compelled to
have. During his time, there were small outbreaks
among the people, and threats of a general insurrection,
which led to more troops being sent out from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the Peninsula. It became necessary now to have
Spanish troops almost altogether, as the native soldiers
could not be depended upon to fire on their
own people.</p>

<p class='c007'>By now there was coming to the front in the islands
a considerable body of thoughtful young men. These
were beginning to demand greater liberty for the Filipinos.
In the Visayas, Graciano Lopez Jaena (grä seä´no
lō´peth hä ā nä) had become a teacher of the people.
This man has been called the “John the Baptist
of the Visayas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The people in that part of the country were in a
position even more hopeless than were those in Luzon.
They knew little or nothing of what was going on in
the northern islands. They had no leaders of their
own, but were dominated by different parties among
their rulers. These parties were constantly quarreling
among themselves and with the government at home.
Between these factions the people lay like corn between
the millstones, crushed almost beyond hope of ever
attaining the smallest human rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jaena was born in Jaro, near Iloilo, and was a student
in the seminario there. Like many young men
of his time, he had the desire to go to Spain and finish
his studies. The friars had taken alarm at the number
of young Filipino men who were doing this, and they
refused Jaena permission to leave his studies at the
seminario. They claimed that, as he was one of their
students, they had a right to dictate how he should dispose
of his life, and where he should pursue his studies.
An action so arbitrary and unjust as this was not to
be borne by a young man of any spirit. Jaena left the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>seminario without the permission of his teachers, went
to Manila, and from there to Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Madrid he made the acquaintance of a number of
members of the Liberal Party, who listened willingly
to what the young man had to say, and made great
efforts to get him an audience with the Ministers of
State. For a time he was well received in Spain, but
the Liberal Party fell into discredit at court, and Jaena
was unable to gain a hearing for any of the reforms
that were so dear to his heart. He lived in great poverty
in Madrid, forced to do menial work to maintain
himself. He was never able to get back to his own
country, for which he suffered so much, but died in
Madrid while still a comparatively young man. He
left a great many writings which are well known
throughout the Visayas. His name is as much honored
in that part of the country as is the name of
Rizal everywhere in the Philippines.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. José Rizal y Mercado (rē thäl´ ē mer kä´dō)
will never be forgotten while there are patriotic Filipinos
left to keep his memory alive. He was a native
of Calamba (kä läm´bä), in Laguna Province, and was
born in the early sixties. He was graduated from the
Jesuit College in Manila, and from there he went to
Europe, where he studied medicine. He was graduated
from Madrid University as Doctor of Medicine
and Philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards he went to Paris and to several German
universities, from one of which he took another degree.
In Germany he became greatly interested in the socialistic
movement of the day. He mingled freely with
the German students, among whom he was very popular,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and shared in their ideas of human rights and
political liberty. He was a true Catholic, but he
longed to see his country freed from the narrow rule
which had made civil government in the Philippines a
farce.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE BRIDGE OF SPAIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The influence of the Orders in the islands had become
known even in Spain as a hurtful thing for the country.
As far back as the year 1870 the Spanish Minister
of State, in a formal report, had recommended
that the friars be removed from charge of the schools
in the islands. Now the demand was becoming general
that their places should be taken by secular priests
who were natives of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rizal believed that it would be necessary to send the
Orders out of the Philippines before the country could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>ever be prosperous. While abroad he wrote a novel
entitled “Nolle me Tangere,” in which he showed
plainly the attitude of the friars and the people toward
one another. This novel was written in the Spanish
language, but was published in Germany. While Rizal
was living as a student in France, he wrote another
political novel, “El Filibustero.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later he returned to the islands, and there did
notable work in his profession of medicine. He became
actively interested in the condition of the country,
as well. In his own town he led a party which
demanded of the Dominican Order that it show title
deeds to a large tract of agricultural land of which
it had possession. This brought down upon him the
opposition of the friars, and he found it wise to return
to Europe. In his absence his relatives and many of
the chief families with whom he had been friendly in
his town were persecuted, and driven from the lands
which they had rented from the religious Orders.
Their holdings were given to Spaniards, and they
received no compensation for their losses.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1893 Rizal went to Hong-Kong, meaning to settle
there and practise his profession. A little later he was
given to understand that it would be safe for him to
come back to Manila, and he came. When he reached
the customs house at Manila, his baggage was rigidly
searched, and it was claimed that among his effects
were found a number of disloyal pamphlets. Among
these were some proclamations which it was claimed
he had written for the purpose of starting a revolt
among the natives.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not common sense to believe that Rizal had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>any of these things in his trunk, and it is now generally
understood that they were placed there by those
who did the searching. His enemies demanded that
he should be executed as a traitor, but the governor-general
would not give him up to them. Instead he
was banished to northern Mindanao, where for four
years he lived very quietly. He practised medicine
there among the people, and many foreigners came
from over the sea to consult him. He performed several
remarkable operations upon the eyes during these
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the Cuban troubles broke out, and, to prove
his loyalty to Spain, Dr. Rizal asked permission to go
to Cuba as an army doctor in the Spanish forces. This
favor was granted him July 28, 1896. He went up to
Manila by way of Cebu, just at the time of the outbreak
of 1896. He was the idol of the people; everywhere
his countrymen were talking about him, and looking
to him as a leader; his name brought them hope
and strengthened their courage. By them he was
regarded as the future liberator of the race, and to
them he represented the promise of liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this so alarmed his enemies that they declared it
dangerous to have him in Manila. He was at once
put on board the Spanish cruiser <i>Castilla</i>, and from
there transferred to the mail steamer <i>Isla de Panay</i>,
bound for Barcelona. He carried letters of recommendation
to the Ministers of War and of the Colonies,
which were sent to him by General Blanco with a personal
letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>His enemies were determined to have his life, and he
was cabled at Barcelona to return at once to the islands.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Certain accusations were made against him, and he was
thrown into prison at the Fortress of Montjierat (mont-hē
ā´rät) in Spain, until a steamer should return to the
islands. Then he was sent back to Manila, a state
prisoner, isolated from all but his jailers.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was brought to trial for sedition and rebellion
before a court-martial of eight captains, with a lieutenant-colonel
presiding; but there was no testimony
against him. How could there be? The facts show
that it was quite impossible for Rizal to have had anything
to do with the revolution of 1896. He had
been a prisoner of state, in seclusion, for years. He
had had no communication with the people of Luzon,
and there was nothing to show that he had taken any
part in the revolt. But he had been condemned beforehand,
and of all the cruel acts of Governor-General
Polavieja (pō lä vē ā´hä), the cruelest was his decree
for the execution of this man.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were but a few days between Rizal’s sentence
and his death. He was engaged to marry Miss Josephine
Taufer, the adopted daughter of an American
gentleman who had been a patient of Rizal’s in Hong-Kong,
and to her he was married on the day of his execution.
He was shot at six o’clock in the morning
of December 30, 1896, and an immense crowd gathered
on the Luneta to witness that terrible sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>His widow joined the insurgents. She was present
at the battle of Silang (sē läng´), and fled with the rest
before the Spanish, tramping through twenty-three
villages on her way to the northern provinces. She
was at last banished from the country by Governor-General
Polavieja. During the American occupation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>she returned for a time to the islands whose welfare
was so dear to her martyred husband. Later she went
to Hong-Kong, where she died, in March, 1902.</p>

<p class='c007'>The name of José Rizal is now hailed with honor.
The government has made the anniversary of his birth
a public holiday, and it is observed yearly in the public
schools of the archipelago. Thus is his memory kept
alive. His unselfish love for his native country should
be remembered and shared by the Filipino boys and
girls now growing up to work for the good of the land
for which he hoped and dared so much.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The Cavite insurrection, which took place in
1872, while not in itself of great importance, was the real
beginning of the rebellion of 1896. It failed through a mistake
in regard to signals. The Spanish authorities overrated
the importance of this uprising, and those whom they accused
of being concerned in it were punished with great severity.
This course drove the people to desperation. Other uprisings
took place, and there was great disturbance in the country.
Many good public works went on, however. The Carriedo
waterworks were built and put in operation, and an effort
was made to raise money to pay off the tobacco growers. In
1881 the tobacco monopoly was done away with by royal
decree of Alfonso XII.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1882 came the great cholera epidemic in Manila. During
the time it raged, 30,000 people died in the city and
province. During these years, teachers of the people began
to rise in the Visayas, as well as in Luzon. Jaena, the
Visayan patriot, was in Spain, trying to obtain justice for his
people. Later, Dr. José Rizal began writing of the wrongs
of his country. He came back to Manila, after an absence
of some years, but was banished to Mindanao. When the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>trouble in Cuba began, he volunteered to go there as a surgeon
in the Spanish army. He sailed from Manila to Barcelona,
expecting to go from there to Cuba. At Barcelona, on the
strength of despatches from Manila, he was thrown into prison,
and later was sent back to Manila. His enemies there
secured his trial on a false charge of sedition, and he was
sentenced to death and executed.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—What was the main cause of the Cavite insurrection
of 1872? Who was Don Fernando Carriedo? When
were the Manila waterworks completed? When was the
tobacco monopoly ended? Who was Jaena? Give an account
of Dr. Rizal and his work.</p>

When the Jesuits left Manila in 1768, the missions
which they had founded were given
to the Recoletos. In 1859 the Jesuits came
back to the islands. These missions, for
which the Society had worked so hard in years gone
by, were returned to it, and other places were made for
the Recoletos. This was done at the expense of the
native priests, and the people resented it. The feeling
was growing among them that the native clergy were
not fairly treated, and the installing of friars in their
places increased that feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be unjust to the Spanish Orders to overlook
the good they did in early years in this country.
They helped the people in many ways. To them
is due the credit of introducing chocolate, coffee,
cotton, and tobacco into the islands. They taught the
people to weave, and to make many things of use.
But too great power fell into their hands, and they
did not keep pace with the times. Besides this, the
people had now come to believe that their spiritual
leaders should be men of their own race.</p>

<p>FORT GENERAL WEYLER IN MINDANAO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Moreover, a feeling of national life, such as they had
never before known, was awakening among the Filipinos.
The many languages spoken among them, and
the tribal differences which existed in the country,
did more than anything else to keep the Filipino
people in subjection. Not until they are a united
people, with one language, and with a common desire
for the welfare of their country, can they take the
place which they should hold among the peoples of
the world. This the more enlightened among them
were coming to see, and were making a steady effort
to unite the tribes in a demand for reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this effort the secret societies, of which mention
has been made, played a large part. These societies
were in the beginning Masonic lodges. The first of
them in the Philippines was founded at Cavite in 1860.
Only Spaniards were members at the outset, but in
time Filipinos and Mestizos were admitted. Later the
members began to take an interest in politics, and little
by little the Masonic lodges came to be the gathering
places of thinkers and reformers. None of these societies
had as yet any idea of revolt against the mother
country; but the people were bent upon securing
reforms in the government of the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible to get justice in any court in the
archipelago. Every public officer knew that good service
and an honorable record would not serve to keep
him in office if anyone who had more influence than
he wished his position. Corruption, bribery, and dishonesty
were the order in the government. All classes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>were taxed to the utmost limit, and the country was
in a state of wretchedness through misrule. The Filipinos
themselves had no rights which anyone seemed
bound to respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The people remembered with bitterness those noble
words of the Cortes which declared, in the Constitution
of 1812: “The countries and provinces of
America and Asia are and ought always to have been
an integral part of the Spanish monarchy. Their
natives and free inhabitants are equal in rights and
privileges to those of the Peninsula.” What the reformers
sought was not separation from the mother
country. They desired only that Filipinos should
be recognized as among her citizens, and entitled to
the rights which this declaration of the Cortes said
were theirs.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the revolt at Cavite, a new secret society was
formed, known as the Katipunan (kä tē pö´nän) or
Association of the Sons of the Country. One of the
passwords of this society was “Gom-bur-za.” This
word is made up of a part of the name of each one of
the native padres executed because of that trouble at
Cavite—Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora. The Katipunan
was composed of the common people. It numbered
many thousands of members, who stood ready to give
their lives for the good of the Philippines, and it was
probably more responsible than any other one thing
for the great uprising of 1896.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1895 trouble broke out among the Moros in the
south, and in that year the Spanish began what is
known as the Marauit (mär ä wēt´) campaign in Mindanao.
This was an expedition against the Moros, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the command of Governor-General Blanco himself. This
campaign proved a great surprise to the Moros, who
were finally overpowered by a division of the Spanish
troops commanded by Brigadier-General Gonzales Parrado
(pä rä´dō). The campaign lasted for three months,
and was a complete success.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this, in order that the government might
keep order there, it was decided to settle the country in
the Marauit district with families from Luzon and
the other northern islands. This decision hastened the
downfall of the Spanish in the Philippines. At first
the Filipino people were invited to go and live in this
conquered territory, but no one accepted the invitation.
It sounded smooth and fair; but it meant leaving
friends and home and security for peril, hardship,
and doubtful adventure. So, as the unwillingness of
the people was seen, the invitation was made more
urgent, and took the form of an order. This order,
however, was only sent to provinces where the secret
societies were supposed to be strongest. It caused
great dissatisfaction among the Filipinos, who quickly
understood its meaning. Many left their homes and
went to live in the mountains to avoid trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government now made still greater effort, and
in 1895 and 1896 there was a systematic persecution of
the people to get them to go south. This persecution
proved too much for even Filipino patience, and in
the spring of 1896 the Katipunan sent a petition to
Japan, asking the Mikado to annex the Philippine
Islands to Japan. It is said that 5,000 Filipinos
signed this petition. The emperor of Japan sent the
petition to Spain, and in this way the names of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>these petitioners became known to the government.
The powers at Manila, however, did not dare to act
at once, but waited their time; and the punishment,
when it came, was all the more severe for the delay.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE BRIDGE OF SAN JUAN DEL MONTE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At this time all the Spaniards in Manila knew that
some great uprising was planned among the people.
The government, however, realized the mistake that
had been made in paying too much attention to the
revolt at Cavite, and it now made the greater mistake
of not paying enough attention to this trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 5, 1896, an officer of the Guardia Civil
reported that over 14,000 men in the valley of Pasig
were pledged to revolt. Still nothing was done about
this by the Spanish until a month later, when a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>number of revolutionary flags and ammunition were
found at Taal. Governor-General Blanco then ordered
some arrests to be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time the Katipunan had its plans nearly
completed. There was to have been an uprising on
the 20th of August; but, on the night before, the plot
was discovered by Father Mariano Gil (mä rē ä´nō
zhēl), an Augustine friar, the parish priest at Tondo.
The authorities then realized for the first time that
the Katipunan was a political society, and Governor-General
Blanco cabled the fact to Madrid.</p>

<p class='c007'>The garrison at Manila numbered only 1,500 men,
many of whom were natives and not to be depended
upon for help; so that General Blanco did not dare
to take the field against the rebels. Nevertheless,
arrests were made daily, and the prisons were full
to overflowing. Among the prisoners were some of
the leading Filipinos of Luzon, many of whom were
merely suspected of disloyalty to the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much time was lost by the Spanish because General
Blanco was unwilling to use force until every honorable
means of bringing about peace had been exhausted.
He felt, moreover, that his army was too small to
justify an advance against the rebels, and so he cabled
to Madrid for help. In return he got word that 2,000
men, two gunboats, and large stores of arms and ammunition
were to be sent at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>By August 30 the uprising was in full force. The
rebels were gathered at San Juan del Monte, a suburb
of Manila, where the first battle was fought. This
took place between the Filipinos under command of
Sancho Valenzuela (sän´kō väl ān thu ā´lä) and three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>others, and some native cavalry and members of the
Guardia Civil. The Filipinos were driven back, and
on that day martial law was proclaimed in Manila
and in the provinces about the bay. Later the rebel
leaders at San Juan were shot on the Luneta. This
was the first of many executions which took place
from week to week afterwards, until the green lawn
of the Luneta was saturated with patriot blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now there was war in earnest between the Spanish
and the Filipinos. The rebellion was growing daily,
and the cream of Manila society was in the jails. Governor-General
Blanco was still inclined to look upon
the uprising as merely local, and not to regard it seriously;
but he was constantly urged to severe measures
by certain of his advisers. They desired that all rebels
caught should be put to death at once, and there
seemed no length to which their vindictive spirit was not
willing to go. The newspapers of Manila were forbidden
to speak of the uprising, or to use the words “rebellion”
or “rebel.” The matter was treated as of
slight importance, and the natives engaged in the insurrection
were spoken of as bandits. This was also
the tone which Governor-General Blanco adopted in all
the despatches which he sent to the home government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Province after province declared with the rebels, until
all southern Luzon was in revolt. Cavite Province
had become the center of the uprising, and Emilio
Aguinaldo (ä mēl´ē ō äg wē näl´dō), formerly a schoolmaster
at Cavite, came to the front as a leader. He
was a native of the city of Cavite, born March 22,
1869, and at this time was about twenty-seven years
old.</p>

<p>DUNGEON AT CAVITE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>By the middle of September, troops to the number
of 6,000 had been sent up from Zamboanga and southern
stations to aid the government at Manila. Nearly
two-thirds of these were natives, however, and the
Spaniards felt that they had good reason to distrust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>their loyalty. The rebels were in great force about
Silang, Imus (ē´ mus), and Novaleta (nō vä lā´tä), and
there were uprisings in Tarlac (tär´läk), Pangasinan,
Laguna, Morong, and Tayabas.</p>

<p class='c007'>On October 1 a steamer arrived from Spain with a
battalion of marines, which was warmly welcomed by
the Spaniards. The next day came another steamer
with more troops, and after that a large number of
men came, until, before the trouble was over, there
were 28,000 Spanish soldiers in the islands. These,
however, were raw drafts. The trouble in Cuba had
taken all of Spain’s fighting men, and she had nothing
to send to the Philippines but boys. These young
soldiers were undrilled, without uniforms, and but
poorly armed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Filipinos were no better off than the Spanish
troops. They were hardier, but they were even more
poorly armed. They had some rifles, but most of their
guns were made of gas or water pipe wrapped with
telegraph wire. They had cannon made from boiler
tubes and from old bells and other metal. But they
were determined and courageous, and were fighting for
what was dearer to them than life—the decent treatment
to which every free man is entitled at the hands
of his government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish treated all Filipinos captured with great
cruelty. From time to time suspects were sent in from
the provinces, bound hand and foot; they were hauled
up from the holds of vessels with chain and hook, and
discharged as cargo, like bales of hemp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rainy season set in, and General Blanco had
not the force at his command which his successor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>had afterwards. The native troops were not to be
depended upon, and it was almost impossible for the
few Spanish soldiers to get about the country. He
contented himself, therefore, with keeping the rebels
out of Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December, 1896, the governor-general went back
to Spain. At that time the total European force in
the islands was 10,000 men. They held the arsenals
at Cavite, and the city of Manila; but the rebels were
strongly entrenched throughout the peninsula of Cavite
and in Laguna Province. “At that time,” says Forman,
the historian, “I was informed by the secretary
of the military court that there were 4,700 individuals
awaiting trial by court-martial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>General Camilo Polavieja was sent out to the Philippines
as governor-general in Blanco’s stead. He
arrived in June, 1896, and at once set to work to
put down the rebellion. He was an energetic military
leader, a man who had himself risen from the
ranks. He had been in Cuba, and his experience
there enabled him to see at once how serious was
the state of things in the Philippines. On the ship
with him came 500 troops, under command of General
Lachambre (lä chäm´brā), and on another ship
1,500 more. Others quickly followed, so that in a
short time, as we have stated before, there were 28,000
fighting Europeans in the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now the dry season, and General Lachambre
at once took the field against the rebels in Cavite
Province. The Filipinos at this time expressly declared
that they were fighting, not Spain, but the
dominion of the Spanish friars. Their battle cry was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Long live Spain! Down with the priests!” The
campaign was conducted very well on the part of
the Spanish. Their troops were better armed than
the Filipinos, and were well commanded, while the
rebels had no trained military officers to plan their
battles. The Filipinos were driven from Imus, and
later from Silang; and although the Spanish met with
great losses, in time the rebels, unable to hold any
one place, were driven up to Laguna Province. By
the middle of March every rebel band of importance
had been scattered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Polavieja cabled for more troops to be sent from
Spain. He wanted these to garrison the districts which
he had taken from the rebels, as his army corps was
needed in the northern provinces, to which the Filipinos
had been driven back. But there were already
200,000 Spanish soldiers in Cuba, and more were
needed there. The Spanish government, therefore,
refused to send any more troops to the Philippines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The newspapers at Madrid made light of the trouble
in the islands, and criticised the governor-general’s
rule. Polavieja then cabled that he was broken down
in health and should be obliged to resign. Through
much of the campaign he was so ill that he could not
sit his horse, and was obliged to direct the campaign
from Parañaque (pä rän yä´kē), where he remained
until after the capture of San Francisco and the driving
back of the rebels into the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>In April, 1897, he went back to Spain. General
Lachambre followed, to receive great praise for the
good work he had done in the Philippines. Polavieja
himself arrived in Spain blind, physically disabled, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>really ill; but he had accomplished a great deal in the
islands, and had gotten the rebellion well in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next governor-general was Primo de Rivera,
who had held that office before, from the years
1880 to 1883. He reached Manila on the 23d of
April, and went to the front on the 29th day of that
month.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—The growth of secret societies in the islands,
and the rebellious attitude of many of the people, led Spain to
adopt a new measure. It was decided to settle the Marauit
district, in Mindanao, with Filipinos from Luzon. Invitations,
amounting really to orders, to go and live in this district were
sent out among the people living in provinces where the secret
societies were supposed to be strongest. Because of these invitations
many Filipinos left their homes and went to live in the
mountains, to avoid trouble. The government then began trying
to force people to go south to live. In 1896 the Katipunan
sent a petition to the emperor of Japan, asking him to
annex the islands to Japan. The emperor sent this petition
to Spain. The government now awoke to a knowledge of how
serious was the revolt in the islands. Many arrests were made,
and soon the jails in Manila were filled with prisoners.</p>

<p class='c012'>By August 30 the uprising was in full force, and the first
battle was fought at San Juan del Monte, on that day. Troops
were now sent from Spain, while from all over the islands
fighting men gathered to the aid of the Filipino leaders. By
December, 1896, there were 10,000 European troops in the
islands. They held the arsenal at Cavite, and the city of Manila;
but the Filipinos held strong positions in the Cavite peninsula
and in Laguna Province. Governor-General Blanco went
back to Spain, and General Camilo Polavieja was sent out
in his stead. The new governor-general carried on the war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>with great vigor. He sent for more troops, until there were
28,000 Spanish soldiers in the country. The Spanish succeeded
in driving the Filipinos back from their strong places, but were
too few to do more than hold them in check. The home government
refused to send more troops to the Philippines, as all
Spain’s armed force was needed in Cuba. Governor-General
Polavieja was taken very ill, and went back to Spain. General
Lachambre followed, soon after. The next governor-general
was Primo de Rivera, who reached Manila April 23, 1897.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—What were the secret societies that now grew up
in the islands? What plan did the government make for settling
the Marauit district? Give an account of the petition
sent by the Katipunan to Japan. When was the first battle
fought in the uprising of 1896? Outline the progress of this
uprising.</p>

One of the first things that General Primo de
Rivera did after his arrival, for the second
time, in the islands, was to issue a proclamation
offering amnesty to all who would
lay down their arms. Many of the Filipinos who were
in revolt accepted the offer, and pledged allegiance to
Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were driven to this step by their fears. The
Filipino forces were weakened and discouraged. General
Polavieja had carried on the campaign against
them with such savage cruelty that the people were
filled with terror. No quarter had been given by the
Spanish, and in Cavite Province alone over 30,000 Filipinos
had lost their lives. Aguinaldo had left Cavite,
which province was now cleared of the Filipino forces,
and had joined General Llaneras (lyän ār´äs), who was
leading the Filipinos in the north, beyond Pampanga.</p>

<p class='c007'>The state of the country at this time was pitiful.
No crops had been planted; there was no food for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>people; their young carabaos had been killed; the rice
and camotes were all gone. War had reduced the
country to a wilderness. Everywhere the authorities
were seeking to put down the rebellion, but their cruel
measures actually made rebels of the people. The
Filipino priests and curates were put in chains, were
flogged and tortured, to make them tell what they
might have learned, through the confessional, of the
secret societies and the movements of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Spanish campaign in Manila was being conducted
by General Monet (Mō´nāt), and there, too, no
mercy was shown to natives so unfortunate as to be
captured. In Pangasinan General Nuñez (nön´yeth)
was fighting the rebels. The war was waged with bitterness;
no quarter was given on either side, and the
natives lost no opportunity to avenge the punishment
which the Spaniards visited upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time the rainy weather was telling severely
on the unseasoned Spanish soldiers. There was much
sickness among them, so that the military hospitals
were full. The soldiers had not been paid for several
months, and they were bitterly discontented.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Filipinos, too, were suffering severely. They
were poorly fed and poorly armed; but they kept up
a constant petty warfare that was very trying to the
Spanish, although it was useless, so far as gaining
any real end was concerned. They now held two
places, Angat (än´gät) and San Mateo, in Bulacan
Province. These had been fortified securely, and they
were by nature such fortresses that it would have been
almost impossible for the Spanish to dislodge any force
from them. The Filipinos were not, however, strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>enough to make any effective warfare against the
enemy, but had to content themselves with holding
these two places and harassing the Spanish as much
as they could.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 2d of July, 1897, the governor-general issued
an edict commanding all who were concerned in the
rebellion to report themselves to the Spanish authorities
by July 10. The edict also ordered all officers,
military and civil, to prevent the people from leaving
the towns or villages, except to till the fields, to look
after their farm properties, or do their daily work. All
who were allowed to go out on such business must be
provided with passes stating where they were going,
by what road they should travel, when they should
return, and what was their errand. Any Filipino staying
out over time, or found on any road or in any place
not mentioned in the pass, was to be treated as a rebel.
The edict also declared that after July 10 all persons
would be obliged to prove their identity by “cedula personal,”
together with the pass. Anyone who failed to
observe these orders, it was declared, would be tried
by court-martial.</p>

<p class='c007'>This measure was so outrageous and so unnecessary
that it had an effect on the people exactly opposite to
what the governor-general hoped for. Those Filipinos
who had been neutral were made angry by it. It enraged
the rebels and drove many others into the insurgent
camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rebels themselves responded by a document
calling upon all Filipinos to rise in defense of the country.
This document demanded that the friars should
be expelled, and that land seized by them should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>returned to the towns to which it belonged; that all
livings and parishes should be divided equally between
the Spanish and the native priests. It asked for representation
by Filipinos in Parliament; for freedom of
the press; for religious toleration; and for more just
laws in the islands. It demanded that there should
be equal terms and pay for Spanish and native civil
servants; that no citizen should be banished from the
Philippines; and that there should be equal punishment
for Spaniards and Filipinos who should offend
against the laws of the land. It declared that the war
would be prolonged until Spain was compelled to grant
the demands of the people. To these demands Aguinaldo
added an appeal to the people to join the rebellion.
Many Filipinos responded, and the force of the
rebels was greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Primo de Rivera now began to urge the home
government to grant some of the demands made by the
Filipinos. The authorities at Madrid were coming to
see that something must be done. The war in Cuba
had so drained the resources of Spain that she had
neither men nor money to expend in punishing the
rebel Filipinos, and it was therefore decided to make
some concessions to their demands.</p>

<p class='c007'>In August, 1897, Señor Pedro Alisandro Paterno
(äl ē sän´drō pä ter´nō), a Filipino, educated in Europe,
a man of means and position in Manila, was made
the agent of Spain to try to arrange terms of peace
with the rebel leaders. He visited Aguinaldo in the
mountains of Bulacan Province. There he talked with
the Filipino leader, and was given power to act in his
name. Aguinaldo stated to Señor Paterno the terms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>on which peace could be made. It must always be
a matter of regret that these terms were never made
public, either by the Filipinos or by the Spaniards.
In the disputes that afterwards arose, the Spanish government
denied the claims made by the Filipinos, and
declared that the terms of peace had included nothing
of what the Filipinos stated had been agreed upon. It
will, therefore, never be certainly known what these
terms were.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_195.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>BIAC-NA-’BATO, WHERE THE TREATY WAS MADE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Certain reforms in the government were demanded.
These reforms were opposed by the friars, whose power
was lessened by them. The friars endeavored to prevent
the government from yielding the terms, whatever
they may have been, and succeeded in prolonging the
trouble for several months.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last, however, Señor Paterno was given authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>to act for the captain-general of the forces in the
islands, representing the Spanish government. On
September 19 he had a meeting with Aguinaldo and
his generals, and an agreement was entered into. This
conference took place at Biac-na-’bato (bē äk´nä´bä tō),
a mountain fastness not far from the famous sulphur
springs, near Angat, in the province of Bulacan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here was made what is now known to history as the
treaty of Biac-na-’bato. It was made between Aguinaldo
and the other Filipino generals on the one hand,
and Señor Paterno, acting for the Spanish government,
on the other. By its terms the Filipinos agreed
to deliver up their arms, all ammunition, etc., to the
Spaniards. They were to give up all places held by
them, and to cease, for three years, all plotting against
the Spanish authority. These three years the government
should have for bringing about the reforms
demanded and promised. Aguinaldo and thirty-four
others of the insurgent leaders promised to leave the
country, not to return until they were given permission
by the Spanish government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government, on its side, agreed to pay the rebels
$1,000,000, Mexican, as indemnity, and to reimburse
the Filipinos not in arms, but who had suffered by the
war, in the sum of $700,000, Mexican. This latter
sum was to be paid in three equal installments, the last
one to be paid in six months after the <cite>Te Deum</cite> should
be sung in token that peace was secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this treaty had been signed, Aguinaldo and his
thirty-four companions were taken to Sual (sö´äl), on
the coast, under an escort of Spanish officers. Here
they and their escort had a feast, and great good feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>towards Spain was expressed by the Filipino military
leaders. Then the exiles were taken on board the
steamship <i>Uranus</i> (ö rä´nus), for Hong-Kong. They
sailed on December 27, 1897, with an escort of Spaniards
of high rank. When they reached port, they
were handed a draft on the Bank of Hong-Kong for
$400,000, Mexican, the first installment on the sum
agreed to be paid them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime there was rejoicing in Manila and
in Madrid. General Primo de Rivera received great
commendation, and was publicly thanked by the government.
On every side were words of praise for his
success as a peacemaker. The Queen Regent presented
him with the Grand Cross of San Fernando
and a pension of 10,000 pesetas a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The people now looked to see the promised reforms
carried out; but, instead, the government seemed to
forget that any promises had been made. The Filipinos
had laid down their arms, and there were about
two months of quiet. Seven thousand of the troops
were sent back to Spain, and General Primo de Rivera
evidently thought that he had broken the back of the
revolt. Business was resumed in Manila. The Spaniards
went on with their pleasures, and matters in
Luzon seemed, on the surface, to be as usual; but
trouble was still in store for the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Persons who had taken part in the rebellion were
arrested, on slight charges, from time to time, and
put into prison; others were openly insulted and regarded
with suspicion, as rebels against the country.
There were many executions, and instead of the general
pardon which was taken for granted as a part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the treaty of peace, only a few pardons were bestowed.
Time went on. No steps were taken toward making
the reforms, and the Filipinos began to see that the
government had once more deceived them.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time the Seventy-fourth Regiment of native
infantry was in garrison at Cavite. This was a very
old regiment in the Philippines. For many years it
had been known as the First Regiment of the Visayas.
In 1886 it was thought that by making the native
regiments a part of the Spanish army another tie
would be formed between the islands and Spain. So
these were all numbered in line with the Spanish regiments,
and the First Visayas became the Seventy-fourth
Regiment of infantry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in 1898, companies of armed men, whom the
government called ladrones, were infesting the province.
The country was in an unsettled state, and
some of these companies—really insurgents who had
taken up arms again—came into Cavite Province. On
March 24, the Seventy-fourth Regiment was ordered
out against them; but, to the surprise of everybody, it
refused to go. The soldiers declared that they were
ready to fight the enemies of Spain or of the islands,
but that they would not march against their own people.
Eight corporals were called out of the regiment,
and the men were again ordered to advance, on penalty
of death to all. All refused, and the entire regiment
was sent to the barracks to await sentence. By morning
it had deserted in a body. On the following day
another regiment joined them.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 25 occurred in Manila one of the most
senseless of the many tragedies which marked Spanish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>rule in the islands. This is known as the massacre
of Calle de Camba (käl´yā dā käm´bä). A number of
Visayan soldiers, in a public house on this street, fell
into a discussion of matters of no especial importance;
but they got to talking loudly, and became excited
over their talk. Some one overheard them and reported
to the police.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_199.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>EMILIO AGUINALDO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Without stopping to ask any questions, a band of
the Guardia Civil came and raided the place. They
shot down a large number of the people, and made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>between sixty and seventy of them prisoners. Some
of these latter were men who had not been in the building
at all, but were merely passing in the street and
were taken along with the rest. Next morning the
whole company of sixty-two were taken out to the
cemetery and shot. The rebellion now flamed up
again, and among the insurgents were two battalions
of well-trained veteran soldiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 3d of April, 1898, a party of 5,000 natives
made a raid on the city of Cebu. The leaders were
armed with rifles, but the rank and file had only bolos.
The Spanish fled before them, and the natives cut
the cable to Manila, so that the refugees could not
communicate with the garrison there. A gunboat
came in from Mindanao that afternoon, however, and
two small boats were sent to Iligan (ē lē gän´) and
Iloilo for troops. These arrived two or three days
later, and were followed by reënforcements from Manila.
The rebels were forced out of the city on the
8th of April, and sustained a crushing defeat. After
that the Spanish chased them back into the mountains,
where they took refuge.</p>

<p class='c007'>This new movement was more serious than any that
had gone before. All trust in Spain was swept away.
The earlier leaders had desired reform, but the Filipinos
now in the field sought first of all vengeance for
the wrongs which had been heaped upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been understood in connection with the treaty
of Biac-na-’bato that General Primo de Rivera would
stay in the islands and see that the reforms were carried
out. Instead of his doing this, however, the home
government recalled him early in 1898, and appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>in his place General Basilio Augusti (bä sē´li ō au gus´tē),
a stranger to the Philippines. He arrived in the islands
early in April, and in the second week of that month
Primo de Rivera left Manila for Spain. Before he
reached Madrid, Spain’s disaster in Manila had taken
place, and the islands were fated never again to come
under Spain’s rule.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—One of Primo de Rivera’s first acts was to offer
amnesty to all Filipinos who would lay down their arms and
pledge their allegiance to Spain. This was a good move, and
many accepted the offer. Later, however, another edict was
issued, which forbade people to leave their towns or villages
without passes stating their business, the roads they might
travel, and the time when they should return. All persons were
also required to prove identity by “cedula personal.” This
measure was so unreasonable and so severe that it enraged the
people, and the rebellion blazed up anew. The rebels issued a
proclamation calling upon the people to join them, and stating
their grievances and demands. The governor-general advised
the authorities in Spain to grant some of these demands. In
August, 1897, Pedro A. Paterno, a Filipino, was sent in behalf
of Spain to confer with the Filipino leaders. He met them at
Biac-na-’bato, and there a treaty was arranged. War was to
cease; and the rebel leaders would leave the country and give up
all plotting against Spanish authority. The government agreed
to pay certain sums to the revolutionists; to reimburse Filipinos
not in rebellion, who had suffered from the war; and to grant
the reforms demanded by the rebels.</p>

<p class='c012'>When this treaty had been signed, the thirty-five rebel leaders
were escorted to Sual, whence they sailed for Hong-Kong, on
December 27, 1897, with an escort of Spaniards of high rank.
At Hong-Kong they were handed a draft for $400,000, Mexican,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the first installment of a sum agreed to be paid them. Business
now went on in Manila. Many of the Spanish troops were
sent home; but no steps were taken toward the promised
reforms, and the people began to see that they had again been
deceived. On March 24, 1898, the Seventy-fourth Regiment
of native infantry revolted when ordered to go against certain
Filipinos who had taken up arms in Cavite Province. Next day
this regiment deserted in a body, and on the following day
another regiment joined them. On March 25 occurred the
massacre of Calle de Camba. All trust in Spain was now at an
end, and the people again began arming themselves. Contrary
to the understanding claimed under the treaty of Biac-na-’bato,
a new governor-general, Basilio Augusti, was sent out, and
Primo de Rivera left Manila in April, 1898.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—What was the edict that caused the rebellion to
break out afresh? What proclamation did the patriot leaders
issue? What did Rivera advise the government to do? What
was the treaty of Biac-na-’bato? How was this treaty kept on
the part of Spain?</p>

In the month of April, 1898, war was declared
between the United States and Spain. The
cause of this war was the feeling of the people
of the United States in regard to the
way in which Spain was treating the people of Cuba
and Porto Rico. These were the only colonies left of
the many Spain had once possessed in the New World.</p>

<p class='c007'>For years Spain had oppressed and ill-treated the
Cubans until human nature could no longer bear such
bitter injustice, and the people rose against it. Spain
poured her armies into the island, and the means which
she used to put down the rebellion were contrary to
humane ideas among civilized people. The United
States more than once protested against them. Spain,
however, paid no attention to these protests. She did
not show in any way what the American Declaration
of Independence calls “a decent respect for the opinions
of mankind.” Instead, she continued her barbarous
course in Cuba until other nations began to feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>that the United States, as the nearest neighbor of that
unhappy country, should interfere.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At last, during the night of February 15, 1898, the
United States battle-ship <i>Maine</i>, while lying in Havana
harbor, was blown up. A mine had been placed in the
harbor exactly where the battle-ship was allowed to
anchor. This mine had exploded, and, as a result, 266
lives were lost of the 353
officers and men who
were on the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>A court was held to
inquire into this awful
event, but it was not
possible to say where
the blame for the catastrophe
belonged. It was
evident, however, that
the state of affairs in
Cuba was becoming dangerous
to other nations,
and was no longer to be
borne. The President of
the United States, in a
special message to Congress, stated plainly that the war
in Cuba must end. Congress then passed a resolution
to declare war against Spain if that nation did not at
once take her army out of Cuba and restore peace there.
As Spain refused to do this, war was declared, first by
the United States, and then by Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time Commodore George Dewey was in
command of the South Pacific squadron of the United
States. This fleet, which numbered ten ships, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>lying in the harbor of Hong-Kong. As that harbor
is under English control, and as Great Britain was
friendly to both Spain and the United States, she was
compelled to treat both nations fairly. To allow the
fleet of one of these nations to remain in the harbor
would have been unfair to the other one; so Commodore
Dewey was notified that his ships must leave
Hong-Kong. At the same time he received orders
from his own government to go in search of the Spanish
fleet and to capture or destroy it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This fleet, as Dewey knew, was in Manila harbor;
and, obeying orders, he at once set out for Manila.
The Spanish ships, seven in number, with ten small gunboats,
were anchored off Cavite. Commodore Dewey
entered Manila harbor under cover of the night, and
when day broke on Sunday, May 1, 1898, his ships lay
at anchor in front of Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>At six o’clock that morning began the famous battle
of Manila Bay. By half-past seven the Spanish flagship
was in flames, and the commander of the fleet,
Admiral Montojo (mon tō´hō) was forced to take refuge
on another ship of the fleet, the <i>Isla de Cuba</i>. By
noon of that day the Spanish fleet was wholly destroyed,
and the admiral and all survivors had fled into
Manila. The Americans had sustained no loss of life,
and only a slight injury to one of the ships, the <i>Boston</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>They next opened fire on the arsenal and fort at
Cavite, and kept this up until a flag of truce was shown.
By sunset Cavite was under control of the United
States, and the Stars and Stripes floated over the town
and the forts at Cañcao (kän kä´ō), Punta (pön´tä), and
Sangley (säng´li).</p>

<p>GOVERNOR-GENERAL AUGUSTI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Commodore Dewey now demanded the surrender of
Manila, which was refused by Governor-General Augusti.
Dewey refrained from taking the city by force,
but declared the port blockaded. On the following
day he demanded control of the telegraph station, and
on this being refused he ordered the cable cut. The
officials in Manila had just time to send the dire news
to Spain before this order
was carried out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Admiral Dewey—for
his government at once
rewarded him by promoting
him to the rank of
admiral—now held the
key to the situation in
the Philippines. He was
in possession of the island
of Corregidor (kōr-räg´ē dör),
of the arsenal
at Cavite, the city of
Cavite, and the surrounding
country. His fleet
lay in the harbor, ready
at any moment to force the surrender of Manila; but
he was awaiting instructions from home and the arrival
of land forces, for which he had asked, before completing
his victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Filipinos in arms had taken fresh courage on
the approach of the Americans, and had closed in about
Manila, so that the Spaniards were literally prisoners
within the city limits. Outside, in Manila Bay, the American
fleet lay, cutting off all chance of escape by sea.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>In the meantime the Filipino leader, Emilio Aguinaldo,
had come to Cavite from Hong-Kong, with a
number of his companions in exile. They had been
given arms from the arsenal by Admiral Dewey, and
Aguinaldo had the admiral’s permission to organize
his countrymen into an army. It was intended that
this army should act with the American forces, when
the latter should be ready to take the city and occupy
the islands. Aguinaldo, however, took advantage of
this opportunity to attempt to organize a dictatorial
government, with himself at the head. Out of his
misguided ambition to rule, great trouble grew, for
Filipinos and Americans alike. The country, already
suffering from a long period of misrule and warfare,
was plunged into still deeper misery. The Americans
were seriously hampered in their efforts to restore
order, and the establishment of peace was hindered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first reënforcements sent out to Admiral Dewey
from America reached Manila Bay in June, 1898, and
were landed on the 30th day of that month. Others
followed very soon, and on the 25th of July General
Wesley Merritt (wes´li mer´it), the first American
governor-general of Manila, joined Admiral Dewey.
On August 7 these two officers together demanded
the surrender of the city, and again on August 9;
but the Spaniards refused both demands.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 13th of August the Americans made a final
demand, and on receiving a third refusal they sent
their land forces against Manila. At the same time
the fleet began the bombardment of the forts and
trenches south of the city. The walled city and the
business district of Binondo were purposely spared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>as it was not the wish of the Americans to do any
more damage than was necessary. The battle was
very short, lasting hardly more than an hour. At
the end of that time the Spaniards yielded to superior
force, and a white flag was hoisted in token of their
capitulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few hours later the Spanish and the American
commanders met, terms were arranged, and Manila
and the Philippine archipelago were surrendered to
the United States. The Spanish flag, which floated
over Fort Santiago, was hauled down, and the Stars
and Stripes took its place.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, on the day before, August 12,
1898, a protocol of peace had been signed between
Spain and the United States. Such a protocol is an
agreement between two nations who are at war with
each other to cease fighting until terms of permanent
peace can be arranged. By the terms of the protocol
it was agreed, among other things, that the United
States government was to occupy and hold Manila
Bay and the city and harbor of Manila until a treaty
of peace should be made between that government and
Spain. It was also agreed that Spain and the United
States should each appoint not more than five commissioners,
to meet in Paris at a date not later than October
1. These commissioners were to arrange terms
of peace, and in the meantime all fighting between the
two nations should be suspended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commissioners were chosen by the two countries,
and met in Paris as had been agreed. It was
not until the 10th of December, however, that they
succeeded in arranging terms. A treaty of peace was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>completed and signed in Paris on that date. It was
ratified in Washington on the 10th of February, 1899,
by the President of the United States and a representative
of the Queen Regent of Spain.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE FIRST AMERICAN FLAG RAISED IN MANILA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Under this treaty of peace Spain, as had been
planned in the protocol, gave up all claim to Cuba;
she ceded to the United States Porto Rico and all of her
other islands in the West Indies, and also the island
of Guam, one of the Ladrone group in the Pacific.
Besides this, she ceded “the archipelago known by the
name of the Philippine Islands,” which for over three
hundred years had been one of her richest colonies.
The United States was to pay Spain the sum of
$20,000,000, gold, within three months after this ratified
treaty was exchanged between the two nations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Other matters were dealt with in the treaty, but
this transfer of the Philippine archipelago is the point
which vitally interests us now. It is because of the
facts which have been set forth in these chapters that
the United States is now in possession of the Philippines,
and that this history of the country is written
in the English language.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the real history of the Philippine Islands has
only begun. The events that make up the past record
of this beautiful land have been but a sad preface to
the future which we hope may be hers. The Filipino
people have had much to bear. They have been shut
away from the rest of the world, and from a knowledge
of the world’s progress. They have been governed by
unjust laws until the great mass of the people, left to
themselves, would scarcely know how to go about to
rule their own lives. But they have a history; they
have a country; they have a future. It is not the
policy of the United States either to forget these things
or to let the people themselves forget them. As the
late President McKinley expressed it—the United
States desires not conquest, but a benevolent assimilation
of these islands, that they may become one country
and one united, prosperous, and happy people.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—In April, 1898, war was declared between the
United States and Spain. Commodore George Dewey, in command
of the American squadron in the Pacific, being ordered
to go in search of the Spanish fleet in the Pacific, and capture
or destroy it, sailed for the Philippine Islands, where he knew
the fleet to be. He entered Manila Bay under cover of night,
April 30, and at daybreak on May 1 his ships lay at anchor
off Cavite. At six o’clock that same morning the battle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Manila Bay was begun. By noon the Spanish fleet was destroyed,
and the admiral and all survivors had fled into the city.
By sunset Cavite was taken. Two months later, American troops
arrived in Manila Bay, and on August 13 the city of Manila
surrendered to the Americans. On February 10, 1899, a treaty
of peace was signed between the United States and Spain.
Under this treaty, Spain ceded the Philippine Islands to the
United States.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—When was war declared between the United
States and Spain? What causes led up to this war? Why
did Dewey have to leave Hong-Kong harbor? What were his
orders? How did he carry them out? When did Manila surrender
to the Americans? When did the first body of American
troops arrive? When was the treaty of peace signed? What
were the terms of that treaty relating to the Philippine Islands?</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The United States is often spoken of as a
free country. Its people are free because
they have a voice in the making and upholding
of their government. There are
strong laws in the land to protect their freedom. No
man and no state can be really free without such laws.
If a man would enjoy liberty, and freedom from the
power of evil, he must obey the laws of goodness. So
a people must honor and uphold the laws of the state,
if the state is to be strong enough to protect their liberties.
We can easily see that if there were no laws,
and each man were free to do as he pleased, no man’s
life or property would be safe. Every man would have
to take care of himself, and the land where such a condition
existed would cease to be a civilized country.
Laws are made for the protection of a people, and
without them there would be an end to liberty and
progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a great many years the government in the Philippine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Islands was by force of arms. It was not a
government in which the people had any voice. They
were ruled by laws made by a power outside of themselves,
and often these laws were against their interests
and welfare. It is hard to make a people uphold such
laws. The government that tries to do this will always,
in the end, have to call in force to its aid. A government
cannot long rule, however, by force alone. Even
a military government, to be successful, must be based
upon just laws. It must recognize and uphold what is
just and right.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of American rule in these islands,
a good many reforms had to be made at once. It was
necessary to set the country in order, so that business
might go on, justice might be done, and safety insured
to the people. Life and property were in danger, and
even among themselves the people hardly knew who
were their friends and who were their foes. The country
needed wise, just laws, strongly upheld, to bring
about peace, order, and safety. At that time a military
rule was the best form of government to meet
this need, and military rule was therefore set up in
the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>This government made many changes in the country.
Courts were established, and every effort was made to
carry out the laws with justice to all. Many prisoners
who had been for years wrongfully imprisoned were
released from jail. Steps were taken at once to open
schools where the children might be taught; and many
other reforms were made that, in time, will show good
results in the country. They are of a sort that will make
this a much richer and happier land. This is what the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>United States wishes to do. It is a great and powerful
nation, and other nations expect it to build up a good
government in these islands. The government at
Washington has declared that the aim of American rule
in the Philippines is to prepare the people for self-government
and to teach them what true liberty really is.</p>

<p class='c007'>In January, 1899, the President of the United States
appointed a body of men wise in government to come
to the Philippine Islands from America. These men
were to learn all that they could about the country and
its people, in order that they might recommend a just
form of government for the country. They had to
find out what were the ideas of the Filipino people in
regard to government, and to study the needs of the
country, before they could make any recommendations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commissioners came to Manila early in April,
1899, and began work at once. They traveled about
the country to see what it was like. They held meetings
in Manila and elsewhere, and invited leading Filipinos
to come and meet with them. They did this in
order to ask them about matters of interest to the
country and its people. They promised the people
that just laws should be established in the country,
and the government is keeping that promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The members of the commission saw that good
schools are a great need in the country. An attempt
was made to provide these at once, and the commander
of the army established a great many schools, with soldiers
as teachers. It was seen, however, that to make
the schools what the people needed would require
experienced teachers. These could not be provided
immediately; but a couple of years later hundreds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>trained American teachers were brought to the islands.
In time, when there are enough trained Filipino
teachers to carry on the work, this country will have
a school system as good as any in the world. The
American Government has pledged itself to bring education
to these islands, and to see that the people have
justice and fair
treatment in all
that touches
their lives. It
will not cease its
efforts until the
Filipinos are as
able to maintain
themselves securely
in their
rights and liberties
as are the
Americans.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>GOVERNOR WILLIAM H. TAFT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The president
of the first Philippine
commission
was the Hon.
Jacob Schurman,
and this commission is known as the Schurman Commission.
The members did the work which they were
sent here to do, and made a full report to Congress.
This report sets forth all that the commission had
learned about the country. The views of the Filipinos
who appeared before the commission are given
in their own words, which were written down at the
time. The report was printed, in order that both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Filipinos and Americans might know all that had been
said and done.</p>

<p class='c007'>In April, 1900, a new commission was appointed
to come to the islands and do further work. This
commission was known as the Taft Commission, its
president being the Hon. William H. Taft. To its
members was given the task of forming a government
for the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>A central government was set up in Manila in September,
1900. Central government means the government
for the whole country. The government of
provinces, towns, and barrios is called local government.
The local government is carried on by the provincial
governors, by presidentes, alcaldes, and lesser officers.
These have authority in their own districts, subject to
that of the central government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The central government at Manila was what is called
a military government—that is, the commander of
the army in the islands was governor-general of the
country. He was the executive, or officer whose business
it is to execute, or carry out, the laws of a land.
As we have seen, the government in Spanish times was
almost wholly a military government. It was a different
sort of military government, however, from that
in which Americans believe. Americans believe that
even armed force is only for upholding the law. It
can never, justly, be law in itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The executive of a country is, as we have said, the
official who executes the laws. In the United States
the President is the executive. The laws are framed
by men whom the people elect to do the work. The
men thus elected become what is called a legislative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>or law-making, body. The chief legislative body
in the United States is Congress. When the central
government was set up here in the Philippines, in
September, 1900, the executive, or governor, was
Major-General
MacArthur, commander
of the
army. The Taft
Commission
acted as the legislative
body, and
had, as well, some
executive powers.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i_217.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>GENERAL ADNA R. CHAFFEE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This government
remained
in force until July
4, 1901. At that
time Major-General
Adna R.
Chaffee succeeded
Major-General
MacArthur as
commander of the
army, and Judge
Taft, president of
the commission,
was made governor of the islands. All the authority
formerly held by the military governor and the commission
now passed to Governor Taft.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new government was not military, but civil.
Under a civil government the law is maintained
through the courts and police powers. Only when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>country, or a section of it, is in a state of rebellion is
the military power called upon to act. Even then it
does not act for itself, but as an arm of the civil government,
to carry out the laws. The civil government
in the Philippines was set up July 4, 1901, the anniversary
of American independence. On that day Governor
Taft was formally inaugurated, or established, in office.</p>

<p class='c007'>September 1, 1901, three Filipino members were
added to the commission. They were Dr. T. H.
Pardo de Tavera and Señor Benito Legardo, of Manila,
and Señor José Luzuriaga, of Negros. The American
members, besides President (now Governor) Taft, were
Hon. Luke E. Wright, Hon. Henry C. Ide, Hon.
Bernard Moses, and Hon. Dean Worcester. Besides
carrying on the present government, the commissioners
were charged with the task of planning a permanent
government for the islands. To do this it was necessary
to have the aid of Filipino members, and the
gentlemen thus added to the commission were a great
help to the Americans in drawing up a form of government
suitable to the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan which has been made and submitted to
Congress is somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>There should be a governor and four heads of departments.
These should be appointed by the President
of the United States. There should also be a
body to be called the Executive Council. This council
would be made up of the governor, the four heads of
departments, and four other members, to be appointed
by the President. Members of the council should be
both Filipinos and Americans. Besides the council
there should be an assembly, of not more than thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>representatives, all to be elected by the Filipino people.
The members of this assembly should serve for
two years. Under such a government the Executive
Council and the Assembly would have the power to
elect two delegates to represent the interests of the
islands and of the Filipino people before Congress.
These delegates would be residents of the islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a system would give the Filipino people what
is called a representative government—that is, they
would have a voice in making their own laws. In
time they would have just as much self-government as
they could fit themselves for. The report of the commission
to Congress recommends that such a government
be begun here January 1, 1904. If this is done,
the success of the government must depend to a great
extent upon the efforts and faithfulness of the Filipino
people themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Summary.</i>—At the beginning of American rule in the Philippines,
the government was military. The commander of the
army in the islands was also governor-general. In January,
1899, the President of the United States appointed a commission
to come to the archipelago and study the country. This
commission is known as the Schurman Commission. The commissioners
came to Manila early in April, 1899. They held
meetings in Manila and elsewhere, and invited leading Filipinos
to come and talk with them on matters of government and the
needs of the country. They spent the year in learning all that
they could about the islands, and then made a report to Congress.
During this year, schools were opened in many parts of
the archipelago, and certain needed reforms were made in the
courts. In April, 1900, a new commission, known as the Taft
Commission, was appointed. It was charged with the task of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>forming a government for the country. The government continued
for another year to be military, but on July 4, 1901, civil
government was set up, and Hon. William H. Taft, president of
the commission, became the first civil governor. Three Filipino
members were added to the commission the following September.
The civil government proceeded to draw up plans for a
permanent government in the islands, and submitted them to
the President and Congress.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Questions.</i>—Why is the United States often called a free
country? Why can there be no real liberty where there is no
law? What are some of the changes Americans have made
in this country? When was the first Philippine commission
appointed? What did it do? What was the second commission
called? What sort of government was established here
in September, 1900? When was the civil government begun?
Who was made first civil governor? When were the first
Filipino commissioners appointed? How does the form of
government recommended by the commission give the Filipinos
a voice in making their own laws?</p>

One of the things which history should teach
us is how to make the future better than
the past has been. History teaches people
about the brave deeds done by their ancestors,
and about what has been suffered for the good of
the land by those who have passed away. It is well
for a people to consider from time to time what manner
of country theirs has been. Only by doing this can
they know how to serve its interests, and to secure for
it the best future that is possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the Philippine Islands a very bright future may
be hoped. How soon prosperity and happiness will
come to the country depends, however, more largely
upon its own people than upon any outside influence.
The Americans in the Philippines can only advise and
teach; the actual work of building up the country, and
of making it a power in the Orient, must be done by
the Filipinos.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us take a look at the country as it is to-day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>and learn something of its nature and of its resources.
Of all the islands, Luzon is the largest, and, at the
present time, the most important. It is a delightful
place, with lofty mountains, fertile plains, and beautiful
rivers. But beautiful as it is to-day, it possesses possibilities
which, if developed, will make it indeed what
the Spanish were wont so proudly to call it, “the Pearl
of the Orient.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the west coast of Luzon are two important bays,
Lingayen (lin gī ān´) and Manila, with several smaller
ones, as Subig (sö´big), Balayan (bä lī´än), Batangas,
and Tyabas, on the west and south. On the northern
side most of the great mountain ranges sweep down to
the sea, sending out spurs of land that form little coves
or harbors; while on the south coast lies the safely
sheltered harbor of Sorsogon (sȯr sō gōn´).</p>

<p class='c007'>The mountains in the western part of the island are
broken up into practically three ranges, none more
than thirty or forty miles long, and all known by one
name, Sierra de Ilocos (sē e´rä dā ē lō´cos). Short
spurs of hills run out from all these, so that there is
very little level land in this section. A plain of small
extent lies about Vigan (vē gän´), and there is also the
valley of the Abra (ä´brä), which is long and narrow.
East of the central cordillera and stretching out toward
the Sierra Madres (mä´drās) hills, is a beautiful valley
over a hundred miles long, and in some parts very wide.
Through it runs the Rio Grande de Cagayan (kä gī än´),
with several smaller streams emptying into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is some of the best tobacco land in the country,
and tobacco is about the only crop raised. It was
made the main crop during the years of government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>monopoly, so that the cultivation of rice, of cocoa, and
of all the native products was driven out. This has
been a great misfortune to the country. The land is
adapted to a variety of crops. It is rich and fertile,
and could be made to raise nearly all the food crops
needed by its inhabitants. The people have come,
however, to depend entirely upon one crop, and in
years when the tobacco crop fails there is great need
in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another great valley, the finest and richest in Luzon,
stretches from the bay of Lingayen to Manila Bay. It
has some 3,000 square miles of fine farming land. The
provinces of Pangasinan, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga,
and Manila lie in this valley. It is a well
watered region. The Rio Grande, the Chico, the
Agno, and the Dagupan rivers flow through it, besides
numerous smaller streams.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the central part of the plain rises Mount Arayat
(ä rī ät´), a volcanic mountain which in a clear day can
be seen from Manila. It is claimed that this mountain
rose suddenly from the plain in a single night, during
some earthquake disturbance in the year 1700. We
find this statement made in apparent good faith by
some scientific authorities. We know that the mountain
is of volcanic origin, and that it was formed only
a few hundred years ago; but there is no reliable record
of when it made its appearance, or of how long it
was in forming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Southward, in Batangas Province, is Lake Bombon.
In the middle of this lake is Taal volcano, whose many
eruptions have in times past worked destruction in that
neighborhood. The lake, also, is of volcanic origin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>There must once have been a great mountain here,
which sank during some upheaval, forming the lake
and the present volcano of Taal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The country all about the lake is very fertile, and
under good cultivation. The principal crop there is
coffee, of which an excellent quality is grown; and formerly
it was produced in very great quantities. Rice,
Indian corn, cotton, and all kinds of vegetables common
to the tropics, grow there in great abundance.
These can be made a source of profit in supplying the
markets of Manila. There is a great deal of alum about
Taal volcano, and it is said that a good quality of iron
is found in the mountains of this province.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Laguna Province is Bay (bī) Lake, or Laguna de
Bay. This is a body of fresh water, with an outlet
by the Pasig River, which flows down to Manila Bay.
Light draft steamers run up the Pasig and through the
lake, and on this beautiful waterway is a constant
throng of craft, going up and down with produce for
the different ports.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is very fine timber in the island of Luzon,
particularly in Tayabas, Camarines Norte, and Ilocos
Norte. Some gold has been found in the mountains
about these provinces, and specimens of many other
minerals have been brought to Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Camarines Sur lies the valley of the Vigan, in
which are several small lakes. There are large rice
fields here, and the quality of the rice is very fine.
Large quantities of it are sent to Manila.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the richest and most fertile parts of the whole
island is Albay (äl bī´) Province, in the southeastern
corner. This is a particularly beautiful part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>island. Here is Mayon volcano, which is called by
scientists the most beautiful volcano in the world. It
is the most perfectly formed and symmetrical, but it is
no more desirable a neighbor than are volcanoes anywhere.
In past years it has wrought great destruction
in the country, but of late has been quiet, and seems
to be on its good behavior.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_225.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>MAYON VOLCANO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The rich volcanic soil of this district will produce
almost anything that can be made to grow in a tropical
country. Very fine hemp grows here, probably the
best that the islands produce. Cocoa, coffee, sugar,
and rice all do well. Cocoanuts, bananas, all the fruits
and vegetables of the islands, grow in Albay, with
scarcely any cultivation. The climate is mild, and very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>healthful, and near Tibi are hot sulphur springs which
are said to cure rheumatism and numerous other ills.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important of the smaller islands lying out
from Luzon are Mindoro (mēn dō´rō) and Masbate
(mäs bä´tā). These are small and very mountainous.
Mindoro is deeply wooded, but only a little is known
of the interior of the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great bay of Manila is twenty miles long and
thirty-two miles wide. It has a depth in some places
of seventy feet. It is entered by two channels, one on
either side of Corregidor Island. The main one is called
the Boca Grande (bō´kä grän´dā); the other, which is
smaller, the Boca Chica (bō´kä chē´kä). The bay is so
large that it is more like an inland sea than a bay; in
fact, it is too large to afford secure anchorage for vessels
during great storms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Visayas form the second large division of the
Philippine archipelago. This is a group of islands, six
in number, which lie between Luzon and Mindanao.
They are very thickly populated. The Visayan people
seem almost a distinct race—different from those of
Luzon, and from their neighbors of Mindanao. They
speak a language of their own, and are inclined to regard
themselves as a separate people. Now that new
conditions prevail in the islands, and there is better
communication between the Visayas and Luzon, much
of this feeling of separation among the people will
probably soon be overcome. It is to be hoped that
it will be. The people of the Philippines must come
to feel that they are one people, with common interests,
and that all must work together to develop the
whole country.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Iloilo, the principal city of the Visayas, is on the
island of Panay. It is an open seaport, and will in
time become a very important city. It was destroyed
during the insurrection, but is now rapidly building
up again. Under good management it will some day
be one of the main shipping centers of the archipelago.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>WEAVING JUSI.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Iloilo Province is a great sugar and rice growing
district. It is, besides, noted for the fine fabrics which
its people make. This is the center for the manufacture
of the cloth known as jusi. The women manufacture
also most exquisite piña cloth. Some of this
is of so fine a quality that it has to be woven in closed
rooms, for the slightest breeze would serve to break
the delicate threads of which it is made. Very beautiful
silk and cotton goods are also made in this province.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Since the American occupation there has come
to be a large demand in America for these goods, so
that the people engaged in the industry are kept very
busy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The island of Negros, which lies to the southeast
of Panay, is an important agricultural island. A great
deal of sugar is grown here, and there is much wealth
in the island. Many of the large sugar estates are
owned by Filipinos. Considerable modern machinery
has been introduced into the island. Steel plows are
in use, and in many places sugar is manufactured by
improved modern methods. All of these things have
helped to make Negros very prosperous. If the planters
here would combine and introduce machinery for
refining their own sugar they would come in time to
an even greater measure of prosperity and independence
than they now enjoy. Rice, hemp, and some
tobacco are raised in Negros, and fine cocoanuts and
bananas grow wild.</p>

<p class='c007'>The island of Cebu is little more than the top of a
mountain rising from the sea. A good deal of historic
interest centers here, however. The city of Cebu was
the first seat of Spanish government, and remained
the capital of the archipelago until Legaspi went to
Luzon and set up his government in Manila. Cebu
was made an open seaport by the Spanish, and although
its exports are not large now, when the resources of
this island are developed the city will become an important
shipping center. There is a large Malay population
in the island. There are no rivers or valleys;
the land is broken up into small farms, and hemp is
the principal crop. The island produces also a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>deal of copra and raw sugar, and the people raise most
of their own foodstuffs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bohol, Leyte, and Samar are all volcanic islands.
They are mountainous, and subject to frequent
earthquakes and similar disturbances. There is not
much agricultural land in Bohol, and the soil is poor
and thin; but a good deal of hemp is raised, and
some cocoa. The people are fishermen and sailors,
and earn their living from the sea. Although Bohol
is much smaller than Cebu, it has a larger population.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leyte ships more hemp than does any other of the
Visayan islands. There are several good harbors on
this island, but Tacloban is the chief shipping point.
Very little is known of the interior of Leyte, for the
country has not been developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Samar is the largest of the Visayan islands, but has
the smallest population. It is a very mountainous
country, wind-swept and beaten upon by the sea. It
lies directly in the track of the northeast monsoons,
which visit it with great fury. Its chief port, Catbalogan,
is well sheltered and a safe harbor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the north of Samar and the southern end
of Luzon lies the famous Strait of San Bernardino.
This is one of the principal entrances into the archipelago
from the Pacific Ocean. It has been the scene
of many a famous sea battle, for here the Dutch and
the English ships used to lie in wait for the galleons
of Spain which brought treasure from Mexico to the
Philippines and carried out rich freights for Acapulco.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next in size to Luzon is the island of Mindanao. It
was on the north coast of this island that Magellan
made his first landing in the Philippines. There are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>four great mountain ranges in Mindanao, with many
high peaks. The island is rich in vast forests, and
some day the world will draw its main supply of fine
building lumber from them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Although Mindanao is of volcanic formation, and has
even within historic times undergone great changes,
there is only one active volcano in the island. This
is Mount Apo (ä´pō), a few miles from the coast of
Davao (dä vä´ō) Gulf. The mountain has three peaks.
The top is covered with sulphur, which sometimes
gleams white as snow in the sunshine and at other
times makes Apo look like a mountain of gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are a number of fine rivers and lakes on Mindanao.
The best port in the island is Balanag (bä lä-näg´),
in the Gulf of Davao. The harbor of Zamboanga
is very good, and there is a still better harbor at Lindangan
(lēn dän´gän). Nowhere on the island, however,
are there such sheltered harbors as are found on
the southern coast of Luzon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very few storms visit this part of the archipelago.
The typhoons only touch one corner of it in the far
northeast. The climate of Mindanao is more healthful
than it has in the past been supposed to be. The
soil is very rich and fertile, and almost any tropical
crop can be readily grown there. Hemp, sugar-cane,
tobacco, coffee, cocoa, rice, Indian corn, and many
other things are raised, and all do well; but the island
is backward as regards development. No serious attempt
has ever been made to build up its agriculture
or its commerce. There are many tribes living among
its mountains whose names, even, are not known to the
civilized people of the archipelago. There are few
Malays in Mindanao, and their manufactures and industries
have never been encouraged. Some gold has
been found in the hills, and silver is plentiful. Coal
has also been discovered in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>It is likely, however, that when Mindanao is opened
up and its resources are better known, it will be found
that its wealth consists less in minerals than in vegetable
growths. We already know that the vegetation
of the island, little as it has been developed, surpasses
that of Luzon and the Visayas. The soil is of
excellent quality, and the rains are so abundant and
the climate is so favorable that the entire island is covered
with vegetation. In the forests are found India
rubber vines, mahogany, ironwood, teak, ebony, and
other trees of great value. There are immense tangles
of bamboo and rattan; hemp and banana trees grow
well, and cloves, nutmegs, and cinnamon.</p>

<p class='c007'>This great island is divided into seven districts—Zamboanga,
Misamis, Suragao (sö rä gä´ō), Davao,
Cottabato (kot tä bä´tō), Basilan (bäs ē län´), and Lanay
(län ī´). Although the population is small in comparison
with the great extent of the island, seventeen different
dialects are spoken among its people. Zamboanga
is the capital town of Mindanao. It has a good
port, although somewhat open to the sea, and in the
river Masdong, three miles to the southeast, is safe
anchorage, protected from all winds.</p>

<p class='c007'>South of Mindanao lies the Sulu archipelago. It is
made up of four groups. The population of this archipelago
is estimated at between 20,000 and 30,000; but
so very little is known about it that this estimate is not
likely to be correct. Joló, the capital city, on the
island of Sulu, is the residence of the sultans. It is
a beautiful town, clean and well-kept. It has a good
port, and a line of steamers runs direct from Joló to
Singapore, and another to Manila. The vegetation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>this archipelago is very like that of Mindanao. There
is abundance of teak, mahogany, cedar, and other
highly prized woods. Horses, cattle, buffaloes, and
goats are plentiful. The people of Joló manufacture
fine knives and chisels. The pearl fisheries of the archipelago
are also very important.</p>

<p>A RIVER SCENE ON THE ISLAND OF LUZON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Lying far off to the west, with the Sulu Sea on one
side and the China Sea on the other, with Borneo
on the south and the island of Mindoco to the
north, is the long, narrow island of Palaúan (päl ä-wän´).
The Spanish called it Paragua (pär´a gwā).
This island is inhabited chiefly by the wild tribes.
There are some 10,000 or more of the native Christian
population, and perhaps 10,000 Moros.</p>

<p class='c007'>Palaúan, on account of its geographical position, is
very important to the archipelago. It will become
important also from a commercial point of view, as it
forms, with the island Balabac (bäl´ä bäk), the Strait
of Balabac. At certain times of the year sailing vessels
are compelled to pass through this strait to enter
the archipelago.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rattan grown in this island is very fine. It is
the best that comes to Manila, and the trade in it is
enormous. The tree from which gum mastic is obtained
grows there in great abundance, as well as other
trees producing resin. The island has fine pasture
lands, with large numbers of cattle, carabao, goats,
and wild hogs; and there are found the famous edible
birds’ nests so much prized by the Chinese that they
sometimes pay for them twice their weight in silver.
The island has not been very well explored, but it is
said to be rich in minerals.</p>

<p class='c007'>South of Palaúan lies the little island of Balabac.
It is only thirty-six miles long and eight or ten wide,
with a population of 3,000 or 4,000. Its only town is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Balabac. Its forest growths are like those of Palaúan,
and there is said to be an abundant deposit of coal
there.</p>

We have now learned something of the different
islands of the Philippine archipelago
and of the possibilities that lie in them.
Much has been done in the past to make
this country a source of income to the Spanish crown;
much, however, remains to be done, to make of the
islands a country whose prosperity shall help the
people themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wealth of a country is not to be estimated by
the amount of its exports, or by the number of its
great buildings, fine harbors, or splendid cities. A
nation may have all of these while the people themselves
are poor. The United States is a great and rich
nation, not because of the value of its national possessions,
but because the great mass of the people are
fairly well off. There can be no real prosperity in a
country unless the people themselves share it; there
can be no just government if that government is considered
as something apart from the people. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>people must have a part in it before it can be a good
government.</p>

<p class='c007'>But before a people can take any real part in the
government of a civilized land, they must understand
something of the principles on which good government
is based. They must know something of the world’s
history and of the government of other countries.
They must have a common language, and must be
a united people, all ready to work for the common
good. That country can never prosper which is divided
by a feeling of race difference, or by jealousies
that make hard feeling among its people.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is because the United States has learned these
things by experience that it has opened public schools
in the Philippine Islands. It seeks to have all the
people learn English, because only by means of a common
language can the Americans and the Filipinos
come to understand one another; only by means of
such a language can the different peoples among the
Philippines come into real harmony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time is coming, too, when English will be the
language of the whole commercial world. Already the
people of other great countries know that they must
learn to speak it for business uses, and it is taught as
a matter of course in most of the schools of Europe.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>
<img src='images/i_238.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE CAGAYAN DE ORO RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>A people must have even more than a common language,
common interests, and modern education, to
become a prosperous people. Not only must men be
wise enough to take part in their own government,
but they must have control of the trades and industries
and commercial ventures of their own land. So
long as the commercial business of a country is almost
wholly carried on by foreigners, that country will never
become rich. It is not meant by this that foreigners
should not be allowed to do business in the country;
that is an idea which belongs to dark ages of the
world’s history. But there should be no need for
them in the country. The people should have such
patriotic pride in the welfare of their own land as
to conduct its business themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, wherever there is a demand for anything
in the commercial world, there will surely, in
time, be a supply. There must be merchants in the
Philippine Islands. There must be tradesmen, artisans,
mechanics, workers in wood, iron, and leather,
and followers of the arts and crafts known to civilization.
If the Filipino people do not take up these
lines of work, and carry them out well and wisely,
outsiders will come in and monopolize them. They
have already come to the archipelago. Moreover,
they will continue to come, from China and Japan,
from India and Ceylon, and from all the countries of
Europe, if the people of the country do not themselves
learn to take their places. So long as the foreigners
are here, there will be nothing for the native people to
do but to work as laborers, or as clerks and servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great resource of the Philippine Islands must
always be agriculture. When modern methods of
farming are adopted here, and modern machinery has
taken the place of the wooden implements and the out-of-date
tools now in use; when we have large sugar
mills and refineries in place of the small and primitive
ones now here, we shall see great progress made.</p>

<p class='c007'>With peace in the country, and good government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>making every man secure in his right to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness, farm work will be very
different here. Nearly the entire population of the
archipelago ought then to draw a good living from
the land. When all the good land is brought under
cultivation, the crops raised in the islands ought to
increase tenfold over what are now grown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before much can be accomplished, however, a great
deal of government work must be carried out. This
the Americans have in view; already some millions
of dollars have been set aside by the civil government
to make roads, harbors, and bridges, and for public
works of many sorts in the archipelago. A day of
hope seems opening, not merely for the Americans
to whom the task has fallen of carrying on the work,
but for the whole Filipino people. They and the
Americans must work together to bring the promises
of this day into full fruitage.</p>

<p class='c007'>No word about the islands can be complete unless it
touches upon the wonderful beauty of this country.
This is a great part of the good inheritance of the
people. It ought to quicken the pleasure and pride
of every Filipino in his beautiful land. Its lofty
mountains, its lovely plains and noble rivers, the rich
verdure that clothes the country, all go to make up
beautiful pictures everywhere. There is much that can
and must be done to make the cities and towns more
fit and beautiful places for people to live in; but for
the outside country nature has done great things.</p>

<p class='c007'>The banana plants and the nipa and cocoanut palms
are beautiful as well as useful. So are the great mango
trees and the fields of growing rice. In all nature there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>is nothing more graceful than the giant bamboos that
grow by every stream. Their beauty is of a very
perfect sort. This plant does more than delight the
eye; of all tropical growths it is the most useful to
man. In a little composition which was written by a
Chinese schoolboy in his own country, a fine account
is given of the many uses to which the bamboo can be
put. He says:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_241.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>MANILA SCHOOLBOYS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“We have a bamboo hedge in our grounds, and
nothing could be better. I am writing with a bamboo-handled
pencil; I have seen bamboo masts on vessels.
On the whole, the bamboo is one of the most precious
possessions of China. Its tapering stalks supply joists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>for houses, ribs for sails, shafts for spars, tubes and
buckets for water, fishing-rods, and the handles and ribs
of our fans. The great bamboo, split, makes an excellent
roof. Rafts are made of the bamboo; baskets are
woven of it. The Chinaman sits in a bamboo chair at
a bamboo table; and he may rest himself, in the heat
of the day, beneath the bamboo tree, with a bamboo
hat upon his head. When I have been all about the
edges of the world, and have seen all kinds of strange
people, I ask nothing better than to come back home
and sit under the shade of a bamboo veranda, and
when my life is finished, to go to heaven from a bamboo
bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To how many other uses than even these do the
Filipino people put bamboo! They make the sails of
ships from it; they build bridges of it; boats, rafts,
water-pipes, scaffolds for building houses, and all kinds
of baskets and furniture. Indeed this plant, with the
India rubber plant and the bijuca, would enable almost
any Filipino to build and furnish a house that would
answer all the needs of the climate.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c007'>We have now studied the main facts in the history
of these islands. The Story of the Philippines has
many sad chapters, but there need be no more such.
The Filipino people have been patient under trial.
They have been forbearing through much injustice
and misrule. They have been brave and patriotic
always. Now we may hope that a new day has
dawned upon the land. What this day will bring
forth depends, to a great extent, upon the Filipino
boys and girls who are now growing up. They must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>learn to be good citizens. They must be able, when
they are men and women, to take a wise part in governing
the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night before José Rizal was shot, he said to a
friend: “What is death to me? I have sown; others
are left to reap.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rizal would have been glad to see this new day.
He would have been glad to see schoolhouses opening
everywhere in the country, for he knew that knowledge
is power. The seeds which he helped to sow
are those of liberty, justice, and peace. The Filipino
people must be wise enough to cherish these seeds into
strong, healthy growth. If they do this the country
will surely reap the harvest which he foresaw, of peaceful
days, full of hope and happiness.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
